Abstract = {{Given climate change predictions of a warmer world, there is growing
   concern that insulation-led improvements in building fabric aimed at
   reducing carbon emissions will exacerbate overheating. If true, this
   would seriously affect building regulations all over the world which
   have moved towards increased insulation regimes. Despite extensive
   research, the literature has failed to resolve the controversy of
   insulation performance, primarily due to varied scope and limited
   comparability of results.
   We approach this problem through carefully constructed pairwise
   comparisons designed to isolate the effect of insulation on overheating.
   We encompass the complete range of relevant variables: latitude,
   climate, insulation, thermal mass, glazing ratio, shading, occupancy,
   infiltration, ventilation, orientation, and thermal comfort models -
   creating 576,000 building variants. Data mining techniques are
   implemented in a novel framework to analyse this large dataset. To
   provide confidence, the modelling was validated against data collected
   from well-insulated dwellings.
   Our results demonstrate that all parameters have a significant impact on
   overheating risk. Although insulation is seen to both decrease and
   increase overheating, depending on the influence of other parameters,
   parameter ranking shows that insulation only accounts for up to 5\% of
   overall overheating response. Indeed, in cases that are not already
   overheating through poor design, there is a strong overall tendency for
   increased insulation to reduce overheating. These results suggest that,
   in cases with acceptable overheating levels (below 3.7\%), the use of
   improved insulation levels as part of a national climate change
   mitigation policy is not only sensible, but also helps deliver better
   indoor thermal environments.}},
