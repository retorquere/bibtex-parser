  annote = {"\textbf{Pipe}" is a sender's estimate of the number of bytes outstanding
      in the network.  This is used during recovery for limiting the
      sender's sending rate.  The pipe variable allows TCP to use
      fundamentally different congestion control than the algorithm
      specified in [\href{https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5681}{RFC5681}].  The congestion control algorithm using
      the pipe estimate is often referred to as the "pipe algorithm".
