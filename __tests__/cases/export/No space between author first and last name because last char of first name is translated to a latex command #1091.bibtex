  abstract = {The Boogie Verification Debugger (BVD) is a tool that lets users explore the potential program errors reported by a deductive program verifier. The user interface is like that of a dynamic debugger, but the debugging happens statically without executing the program. BVD integrates with the programverification engine Boogie. Just as Boogie supports multiple language front-ends, BVD can work with those front-ends through a plug-in architecture. BVD plugins have been implemented for two state-of-the-art verifiers, VCC and Dafny.},
