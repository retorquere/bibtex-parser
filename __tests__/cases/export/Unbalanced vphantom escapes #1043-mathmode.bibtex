  abstract = {The results of a close-coupling calculation of the fine-structure transitions (j,mj{$\rightarrow$}j{${'}$},m{${'}$}j) are presented for collisions between photons and F(Pj,mj2). The theory is formulated in the perturbed-stationary-state approximation using accurate molecular wave functions for the ground II2 and {$\Sigma$}2 states of HF+. Comparison is made to the predictions of the Born approximation. The magnetic selection rule (j,mj{$\rightarrow$}j,-mj) is strongly violated in the j=32 state and less strongly violated in the j=12 state. It is concluded that the important region of interaction for the j=12{$\rightarrow$}j=32 transition is at short-to-intermediate distances where accurate molecular potentials are required and close-coupling effects are dominant.},
