It was found that the nitrogen atom adsorbs close to the atop position with an angle of 18°( + 2°− 4°) between the NNi bond and the surface normal. The NNi bond length is 1.97 ± 0.03 Å. Since recent X-ray absorption studies show that the π system of the pyridine is also tilted by about 20° away from the surface normal, we conclude that the NNi bond and the ring plane are co-planar.",
