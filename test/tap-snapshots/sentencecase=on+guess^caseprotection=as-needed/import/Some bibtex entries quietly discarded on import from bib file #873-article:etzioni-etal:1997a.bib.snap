          "Abstract: Closed-world inference-an essential component of many planning algorithms-is the process of determining that a logical sentence is false based on its absence from a knowledge base, or the inability to derive it. We describe a novel method for closed-world inference and update over the first-order theories of action used by planning algorithms such as NONLIN, TWEAK, and UCPOP. We show the method to be sound and efficient, but incomplete. In our experiments, closed-world inference consistently averaged about 2 milliseconds while updates averaged approximately 1.2 milliseconds. Furthermore, we demonstrate that incompleteness is nonproblematic in practice, since our mechanism makes over 99% of the desired inferences. We incorporated our method into the XII planner, which supports our Internet Softbot (software robot). The technique cut the number of actions executed by the Softbot by a factor of one hundred, and resulted in a corresponding speedup to XII.",
