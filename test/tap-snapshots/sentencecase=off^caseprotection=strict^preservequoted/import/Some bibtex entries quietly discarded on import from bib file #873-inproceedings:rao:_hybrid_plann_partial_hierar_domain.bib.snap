In many domains, human expertise in the form of hierarchical reduction schemas exists, but is incomplete. In such domains, hybrid approaches that use both HTN and action-based planning techniques are needed. In this paper, we extend our previous work on refinement planning to include hierarchical planning. Specifically, we provide a generalized plan-space refinement that is capable of handling non-primitive actions. The generalization provides a principled way of handling partially hierarchical domains, while preserving systematicity, and respecting the user-intent inherent in the reduction schemas. Our general account also puts into perspective the many surface differences between the HTN and action-based planners, and could support the transfer of progress between HTN and action-based planning approaches.",

Hard to tell how well this works out, since there are a whole bunch of fairly complex bits necessary to ensure completeness and systematicity. The latter could, of course, be sacrificed.
