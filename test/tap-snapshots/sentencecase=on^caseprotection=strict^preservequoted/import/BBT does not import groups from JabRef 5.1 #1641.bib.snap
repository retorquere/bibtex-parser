          "Logic of Sense is one of Deleuze's seminal works. First published in 1969, shortly after Difference and Repetition, it prefigures the hybrid style and methods he would use in his later writing with Felix Guattari. In an early review Michel Foucault wrote that Logic of Sense 'should be read as the boldest and most insolent of metaphysical treatises'. The book is divided into 34 'series' and five appendices covering a diverse range of topics including, sense, nonsense, event, sexuality, psychoanalysis, paradoxes, schizophrenia, literature and becoming and includes fascinating close textual readings of works by Lewis Carroll, Sigmund Freud, Seneca, Pierre Klossowski, F. Scott Fitzgerald, and Émile Zola. Logic of Sense is essential reading for anyone interested in post-war continental thought. Contents Preface: From Lewis Carroll to the Stoics First Series of Paradoxes of Pure Becoming Second Series of Paradoxes of Surface Effects Third Series of the Proposition Fourth Series of Dualities Fifth Series of Sense Sixth Series on Serialization Seventh Series of Esoteric Words Eighth Series of Structure Ninth Series of the Problematic Tenth Series of the Ideal Game Eleventh Series of Nonsense Twelfth Series of the Paradox Thirteenth Series of the Schizophrenic and the Little Girl Fourteenth Series of Double Causality Fifteenth Series of Singularities Sixteenth Series of the Static Ontological Genesis Seventeenth Series of the Static Logical Genesis Eighteenth Series of the Three Images of Philosophers Nineteenth Series of Humor Twentieth Series on the Moral Problem in Stoic Philosophy Twenty-First Series of the Event Twenty-Second Series-Porcelain and Volcano Twenty-Third Series of the Aion Twenty-Fourth Series of the Communication of Events Twenty-Fifth Series of Univocity Twenty-Sixth Series of Language Twenty-Seventh Series of Orality Twenty-Eighth Series of Sexuality Twenty-Ninth Series-Good Intentions Are Inevitably Punished Thirtieth Series of the Phantasm Thirty-First Series of Thought Thirty-Second Series on the Different Kinds of Series Thirty-Third Series of Alice's Adventures Thirty-Fourth Series of Primary Order and Secondary Organization Appendixes I.

          "An ancient ethics for modern life - Develops an original ethics of motion for the 21st century from Lucretius' didactic poem De Rerum Natura - Argues uniquely that Lucretius had a distinct ethical theory from Epicurus - Puts Lucretius in conversation with contemporary physics and new materialism Lucretius II launch offer - Find out where it all started: we're offering a free ebook of Lucretius I when you buy a copy of Lucretius II. Just add a copy of Lucretius II (paperback, hardback or ebook) and a Lucretius I ebook to your basket, and enter the code Lucretius2 when you check out. Visit the webpage for Lucretius I Human suffering, the fear of death, war, poverty, ecological destruction and social inequality: almost 2,000 ago Lucretius proposed an ethics of motion as simple and stunning solution to these ethical problems. Thomas Nail argues that Lucretius was the first to locate the core of all these ethical ills in our obsession with stasis, our fear of movement and our hatred of matter. Instead of trying to transcend nature with our minds, escape it with our immortal souls and dominate it with our technologies, Lucretius was perhaps the first in the Western tradition to forcefully argue for a completely materialist, immanent and naturalistic ethics based on moving well with and as nature. If we want to survive and live well on this planet, Lucretius taught us, our best chance is not to struggle against nature but to embrace it and facilitate its movement. Lucretius II is the second installment in Thomas Nail's transformative reading of Lucretius' didactic poem De Rerum Natura, which can be read individually or as a trilogy. Lucretius I covered books 1 and 2 of De Rerum Natura and looked at Lucretius' ontology; this volume covers books 3 and 4 and Lucretius' ethics. The third and final volume will cover books 5 and 6.",
