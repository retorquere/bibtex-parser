          "Wow! A paper containing the germs of a vast amount of other work. Explains how <span class=\\"nocase\\"><span style=\\"font-variant:small-caps;\\">Strips</span></span> plans are to be executed, stored, and reused. The key to all of these techniques are the <span class=\\"nocase\\"><i>triangle tables</i></span>, which are a limited form of explanation-based learning. They also underly the approach to execution monitoring. For the plan monitoring, the triangle table contains a cached out representation of the preconditions necessary for execution of each plan suffix. So the executor monitors the truth of each of these preconditions, allowing it both to re-execute failed prefixes and exploit opportunities to skip steps.",
