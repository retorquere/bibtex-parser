          "Hierarchical task network and action-based planning approaches have traditionally been studied separately. In many domains, human expertise in the form of hierarchical reduction schemas exists, but is incomplete. In such domains, hybrid approaches that use both HTN and action-based planning techniques are needed. In this paper, we extend our previous work on refinement planning to include hierarchical planning. Specifically, we provide a generalized plan-space refinement that is capable of handling non-primitive actions. The generalization provides a principled way of handling partially hierarchical domains, while preserving systematicity, and respecting the user-intent inherent in the reduction schemas. Our general account also puts into perspective the many surface differences between the HTN and action-based planners, and could support the transfer of progress between HTN and action-based planning approaches.",

          "Fits HTN planning into Rao's unifying framework. Also shows how to do this in partially hierarchical domains, i.e., those where some goals do not have methods and use normal precondition-chaining. This doesn't really arise in our playbook applications, but it's very neat. Hard to tell how well this works out, since there are a whole bunch of fairly complex bits necessary to ensure completeness and systematicity. The latter could, of course, be sacrificed. Seems to subsume the hierarchical planning in DPOCL and Barrent and Weld, which is handy! It's always nice to be able to not read a paper!",
