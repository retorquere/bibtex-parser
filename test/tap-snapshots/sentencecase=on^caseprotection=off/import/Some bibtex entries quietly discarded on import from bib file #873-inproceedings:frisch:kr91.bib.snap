Essentially the approach is to perform a Moore-like translation of the modal logic statements into a first order representation with explicit representation of the accessibility relations and existence of entities (for modal logics with different domains in different possible worlds). This representation is then partititioned into a set of statements and an associated set of constraints on relationships between possible worlds. When variables are unified, the associated world constraints must be verified.",
