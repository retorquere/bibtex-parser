          "Cohen and Levesque critique KQML on three semantic grounds: ambiguity of specifications; misidentified performatives and performatives missing. The misidentified performatives are those that operate on other performatives where Cohen and Levesque argue that they should be operating directly on content. The major missing performative they identify is a commissive — the agreement to perform an action. They then propose that their logic of intention could be used to give a superior semantics. They conclude with some weak suggestions about the implications of this. Unfortunately, their semantics seem to be too “first principles-y” to be of much use to implementors. Finally, they say that extensibility and content independence are problems. It is hard to see how this is to be remedied.",
