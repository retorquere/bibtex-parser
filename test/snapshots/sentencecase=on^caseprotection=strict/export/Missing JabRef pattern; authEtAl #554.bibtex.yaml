        Let X be a projective variety which is algebraic Lang hyperbolic. We
        show that Lang's conjecture holds (one direction only): X and all its
        subvarieties are of general type and the canonical divisor K_X is ample
        at smooth points and Kawamata log terminal points of X, provided that
        K_X is Q-Cartier, no Calabi-Yau variety is algebraic Lang hyperbolic and
        a weak abundance conjecture holds.
