        In last decade, cryptocurrency has emerged in financial area as a key
        factor in businesses and financial market opportunities. Accurate
        predictions can assist cryptocurrency investors towards right investing
        decisions and lead to potential increased profits. Additionally, they
        can also support policy makers and financial researchers in studying
        cryptocurrency markets behavior. Nevertheless, cryptocurrency price
        prediction is considered a very challenging task, due to its chaotic and
        very complex nature. In this study we evaluate some of the most
        successful and widely used deep learning algorithms forecasting
        cryptocurrency prices. The results obtained, provide significant
        evidence that deep learning models are not able to solve this problem
        efficiently and effectively. Conducting detailed experimentation and
        results analysis, we conclude that it is essential to invent and
        incorporate new techniques, strategies and alternative approaches such
        as: more sophisticated prediction algorithms, advanced ensemble methods,
        feature engineering techniques and other validation metrics.
