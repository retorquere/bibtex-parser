        Planning is a central activity in many areas including robotics,
        manufacturing, space mission sequencing, and logistics. As the size and
        complexity of planning problems grow, there is great economic pressure
        to automate this process in order to reduce the cost of planning effort,
        and to improve the quality of produced plans. AI planning research has
        focused on general-purpose planning systems which can process the
        specifications of an application domain and generate solutions to
        planning problems in that domain. Unfortunately, there is a big gap
        between theoretical and application oriented work in AI planning. The
        theoretical work has been mostly based on state-based planning, which
        has limited practical applications. The application-oriented work has
        been based on hierarchical task network (HTN) planning, which lacks a
        theoretical foundation. As a result, in spite of many years of research,
        building planning applications remains a formidable task. The goal of
        this dissertation is to facilitate building reliable and effective
        planning applications. The methodology includes design of a mathematical
        framework for HTN planning, analysis of this framework, development of
        provably correct algorithms based on this analysis, and the
        implementation of these algorithms for further evaluation and
        exploration. The representation, analyses, and algorithms described in
        this thesis will make it easier to apply HTN planning techniques
        effectively and correctly to planning applications. The precise and
        mathematical nature of the descriptions will also help teaching about
        HTN planning, will clarify misconceptions in the literature, and will
        stimulate further research.
