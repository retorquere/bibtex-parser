        Before architectural conservation takes place, a survey is conducted to
        assess the condition of the building and estimate the cost of the work.
        For façades, scaffolding is erected so that experts can access the
        building's whole extent and gather data for analysis. This paper
        presents the results of a collaborative and cross-disciplinary research
        project aiming to automate data capture and analysis techniques for
        conservation of stone façades. Our research demonstrates the
        feasibility of a new methodology for the survey and assessment of
        historic buildings and will facilitate frequent surveys with minimal
        disruption to the general public in cities. The project has embedded
        architects' expert knowledge into intelligent algorithms for
        automatically analysing images of facades. The combination of
        technologies allows for an efficient data capture while minimising the
        requirement for manual data analysis as well as more accurate estimates
        of its cost.
