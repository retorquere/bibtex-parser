        We study the energy used by a production-level regional climate and
        weather simulation code on a distributed memory system with hybrid
        CPU-GPU nodes. The code is optimised for both processor architectures,
        for which we investigate both time and energy to solution. Operational
        constraints for time to solution can be met with both processor types,
        although on different numbers of nodes. Energy to solution is a factor 3
        lower with GPUs, but strong scaling can be pushed to larger node counts
        with CPUs to minimize time to solution. Our data shows that an affine
        relationship exists between energy and nodehours consumed by the
        simulation. We use this property to devise a simple and practical
        methodology for optimising for energy efficiency that can be applied to
        other applications, which we demonstrate with the HPCG benchmark. We
        conclude with a discussion about the relationship to the commonly-used
        GF/Watt metric.
