        Abstract Planning is motivated by acting. Most of the existing work on
        automated planning underestimates the reasoning and deliberation needed
        for acting; it is instead biased towards path-finding methods in a
        compactly specified state-transition system. Researchers in this {AI}
        field have developed many planners, but very few actors. We believe this
        is one of the main causes of the relatively low deployment of automated
        planning applications. In this paper, we advocate a change in focus to
        actors as the primary topic of investigation. Actors are not mere plan
        executors: they may use planning and other deliberation tools, before
        and during acting. This change in focus entails two interconnected
        principles: a hierarchical structure to integrate the actorʼs
        deliberation functions, and continual online planning and reasoning
        throughout the acting process. In the paper, we discuss open problems
        and research directions toward that objective in knowledge
        representations, model acquisition and verification, synthesis and
        refinement, monitoring, goal reasoning, and integration.
