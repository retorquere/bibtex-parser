        Erol, et. al. discuss the complexity and expressivity of HTN planning
        based on their UMCP planning. They show that HTN planning is strictly
        more expressive than simple STRIPS planning. The reason HTN planning is
        more expressive is that having a goal task network instead of a
        propositional goal allows the user of the system to specify not just
        what is to be achieved, but some aspects of how it is to be achieved.
        They use the example that in an HTN planner one can specify the goal of
        “build a house,” as distinct from simply “own a house,” which could also
        be satisfied by “buy a house.” As far as expressivity is concerned, HTN
        planning in the general case is undecidable. Forcing HTNs to be
        totally-ordered sets of tasks or removing variables from the tasks can
        reduce the complexity.
