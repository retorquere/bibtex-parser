        This article describes work on using keyhole plan recognition to monitor
        other team members to verify that the team are working together
        succesfully. The method is particularly of use in cases where
        agent-to-communications are not reliable. An extra bonus of the article
        is that it provides a useful hook into the literature on team action and
        shared plans.
