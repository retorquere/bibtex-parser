        Hierarchical task network and action-based planning approaches have
        traditionally been studied separately. In many domains, human expertise
        in the form of hierarchical reduction schemas exists, but is incomplete.
        In such domains, hybrid approaches that use both HTN and action-based
        planning techniques are needed. In this paper, we extend our previous
        work on refinement planning to include hierarchical planning.
        Specifically, we provide a generalized plan-space refinement that is
        capable of handling non-primitive actions. The generalization provides a
        principled way of handling partially hierarchical domains, while
        preserving systematicity, and respecting the user-intent inherent in the
        reduction schemas. Our general account also puts into perspective the
        many surface differences between the HTN and action-based planners, and
        could support the transfer of progress between HTN and action-based
        planning approaches.

        Fits HTN planning into Rao's unifying framework. Also shows how to do
        this in partially hierarchical domains, i.e., those where some goals do
        not have methods and use normal precondition-chaining. This doesn't
        really arise in our playbook applications, but it's very neat. Hard to
        tell how well this works out, since there are a whole bunch of fairly
        complex bits necessary to ensure completeness and systematicity. The
        latter could, of course, be sacrificed. Seems to subsume the
        hierarchical planning in DPOCL and Barrent and Weld, which is handy!
        It's always nice to be able to not read a paper!
