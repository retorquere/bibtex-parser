        Infants use “unexpectedness” as a "cue" for learning. Stahl and
        Feigenson studied how babies reacted when objects behaved in surprising
        ways (see the Perspective by Schulz). Babies who saw apparently solid
        and weighty objects moving through a wall or past the edge of a table
        without falling looked intently at them. When given the opportunity to
        explore these peculiar objects, they did so by banging them on the
        floor—as if to test their solidity—or dropping them—as if to test their
        weightiness.
