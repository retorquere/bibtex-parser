        Contains a description of the typed, object-oriented, language for HTN
        planners. The work is interesting and offers checking to make sure that
        transitions are well-founded, in terms of the objects that make up the
        domain. Somewhat limited, however, in terms of the richness of the
        object hierarchy, and the sorts of things that an HTN method is allowed
        to do. There's a discussion of how OCLₕ could be used to formalize
        O-Plan operators.
