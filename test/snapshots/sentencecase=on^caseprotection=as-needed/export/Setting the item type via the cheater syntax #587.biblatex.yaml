      *16th edition only.* A Review entry presenting a review from a scholarly
      journaltitle, hence no entrysubtype needed.~~Note the bibstrings in the
      title of the review, and the formatting of the title of the book reviewed
      there.~~Also note the use of \textbackslash parteditandtrans.~~The
      author-date system doesn't absolutely require the use of these mechanisms,
      which were invented to cope with the differences between notes and
      bibliography in the other Chicago style.~~Still, although simply writing
      "edited and translated by" yourself will suffice, using these mechanisms
      will make your .bib file work across multiple languages, and will also
      allow it to work, with fewer modifications, in the notes \textbackslash\&
      bibliography style, should that be needed.~~See next entry.
