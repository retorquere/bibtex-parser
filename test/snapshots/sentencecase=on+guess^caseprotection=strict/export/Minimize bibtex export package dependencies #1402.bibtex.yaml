        We point out a simple relation between the nuclear vertex constant (NVC)
        and the overall normalization of the astrophysical S factor. Using
        predicted values of the NVC for the virtual decay of 8B→7Be+p we find
        S17(0)≈17.6 eVb for 7Be(p,γ)8B reactions, consistent with the low values
        extrapolated from direct capture measurements by Filippone et al. and by
        Vaughn et al. New possibilities, using proton transfer reactions, to
        measure the astrophysical S factor indirectly are proposed.
