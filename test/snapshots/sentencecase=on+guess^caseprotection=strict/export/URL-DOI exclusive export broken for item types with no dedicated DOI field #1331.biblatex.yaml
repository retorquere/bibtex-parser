        Bioconductor is a widely used open source and open development software
        project for the analysis and comprehension of data arising from
        high-throughput experimentation in genomics and molecular biology.
        Bioconductor is rooted in the open source statistical computing
        environment R. This volume's coverage is broad and ranges across most of
        the key capabilities of the Bioconductor project, including importation
        and preprocessing of high-throughput data from microarray, proteomic,
        and flow cytometry platforms curation and delivery of biological
        metadata for use in statistical modeling and interpretation statistical
        analysis of high-throughput data, including machine learning and
        visualization, modeling and visualization of graphs and networks. The
        developers of the software, who are in many cases leading academic
        researchers, jointly authored chapters. All methods are illustrated with
        publicly available data, and a major section of the book is devoted to
        exposition of fully worked case studies. This book is more than a static
        collection of descriptive text, figures, and code examples that were run
        by the authors to produce the text; it is a dynamic document. Code
        underlying all of the computations that are shown is made available on a
        companion website, and readers can reproduce every number, figure, and
        table on their own computers.
