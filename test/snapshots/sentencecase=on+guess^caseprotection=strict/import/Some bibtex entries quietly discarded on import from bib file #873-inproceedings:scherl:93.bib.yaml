        Provides a representation of knowledge-producing actions in the
        situation calculus. Extends Reiter's explanation-closure solution to the
        frame problem to this extended situation calculus (in which successor
        state axioms are automatically generated from General Positive Effect
        and General Negative Effect axioms). The authors show that
        knowledge-producing actions can be handled using Reiter's
        explanation-closure approach. Further, they extend Reiter's regression
        operators to knowledge-producing actions. This permits one to check
        properties of a plan (e.g., does it achieve a particular goal
        proposition) by regressing those properties to the initial situation and
        then doing theorem-proving exclusively in that initial situation.
