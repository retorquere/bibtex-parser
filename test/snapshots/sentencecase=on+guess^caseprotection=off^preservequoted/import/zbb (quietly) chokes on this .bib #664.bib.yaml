        Do societies choose inefficient policies and institutions? An extension
        of the Coase theorem to politics would suggest the answer is no. This
        paper discusses various approaches to political economy and develops the
        argument that there are strong empirical and theoretical grounds for
        believing that inefficient policies and institutions are prevalent. We
        conclude that these inefficient institutions and policies are chosen
        because they serve the interests of politicians or social groups that
        hold political power at the expense of the rest. The theoretical case
        depends on commitment problems inherent in politics; parties holding
        political power cannot make commitments to bind their future actions
        because there is no outside agency with the coercive capacity to enforce
        such arrangements. Journal of Comparative Economics 31 (4) (2003)
        620-652.
