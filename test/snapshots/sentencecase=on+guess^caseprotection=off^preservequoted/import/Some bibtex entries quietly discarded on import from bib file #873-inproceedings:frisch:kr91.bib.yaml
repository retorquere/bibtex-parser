        Describes a general constraint-based approach to modal logic deduction.
        Essentially the approach is to perform a Moore-like translation of the
        modal logic statements into a first order representation with explicit
        representation of the accessibility relations and existence of entities
        (for modal logics with different domains in different possible worlds).
        This representation is then partititioned into a set of statements and
        an associated set of constraints on relationships between possible
        worlds. When variables are unified, the associated world constraints
        must be verified.
