        Etzioni et. al. provide a notion of dynamic closed-world reasoning. They
        do this by having, in addition to a database recording world state
        propositions, a local closed world (LCW) database, that records
        propositions about whose value they have complete knowledge. They
        present methods for updating LCW knowledge in response to the execution
        of actions and show that these update methods are sound and tractable,
        although not complete.
