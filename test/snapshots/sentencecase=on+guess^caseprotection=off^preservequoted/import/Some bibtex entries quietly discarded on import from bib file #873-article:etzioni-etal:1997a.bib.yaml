        Abstract: Closed-world inference-an essential component of many planning
        algorithms-is the process of determining that a logical sentence is
        false based on its absence from a knowledge base, or the inability to
        derive it. We describe a novel method for closed-world inference and
        update over the first-order theories of action used by planning
        algorithms such as NONLIN, TWEAK, and UCPOP. We show the method to be
        sound and efficient, but incomplete. In our experiments, closed-world
        inference consistently averaged about 2 milliseconds while updates
        averaged approximately 1.2 milliseconds. Furthermore, we demonstrate
        that incompleteness is nonproblematic in practice, since our mechanism
        makes over 99incorporated our method into the XII planner, which
        supports our Internet Softbot (software robot). The technique cut the
        number of actions executed by the Softbot by a factor of one hundred,
        and resulted in a corresponding speedup to XII.
