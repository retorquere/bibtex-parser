        Martha Pollack's rant, based on Bratman, somewhat, that plans are
        useful. Contra the then-popular push for reactive `planners.' Also
        argues for a kind of qualitative decision theory. A la Bratman, argues
        that committing to intentions provides a useful control of reasoning.
        Discusses experiments with the IRMA planning architecture.
