        The adsorption site of pyridine (C5H5N) on Ni{111} has been investigated
        by scanned-energy mode photoelectron diffraction using the N 1s core
        level. It was found that the nitrogen atom adsorbs close to the atop
        position with an angle of 18°( + 2°− 4°) between the NNi bond and the
        surface normal. The NNi bond length is 1.97 ± 0.03 Å. Since recent
        X-ray absorption studies show that the π system of the pyridine is also
        tilted by about 20° away from the surface normal, we conclude that the
        NNi bond and the ring plane are co-planar.
