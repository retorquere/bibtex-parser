        Functional connectivity analysis of resting state blood oxygen
        level-dependent (BOLD) functional MRI is widely used for noninvasively
        studying brain functional networks. Recent findings have indicated,
        however, that even small (≤1 mm) amounts of head movement during
        scanning can disproportionately bias connectivity estimates, despite
        various preprocessing efforts. Further complications for interregional
        connectivity estimation from time domain signals include the unaccounted
        reduction in BOLD degrees of freedom related to sensitivity losses from
        high subject motion. To address these issues, we describe an integrated
        strategy for data acquisition, denoising, and connectivity estimation.
        This strategy builds on our previously published technique combining
        data acquisition with multiecho (ME) echo planar imaging and analysis
        with spatial independent component analysis (ICA), called ME-ICA, which
        distinguishes BOLD (neuronal) and non-BOLD (artifactual) components
        based on linear echo-time dependence of signals-a characteristic
        property of BOLD T*2 signal changes. Here we show for 32 control
        subjects that this method provides a physically principled and nearly
        operator-independent way of removing complex artifacts such as motion
        from resting state data. We then describe a robust estimator of
        functional connectivity based on interregional correlation of
        BOLD-independent component coefficients. This estimator, called
        independent components regression, considerably simplifies statistical
        inference for functional connectivity because degrees of freedom equals
        the number of independent coefficients. Compared with traditional
        connectivity estimation methods, the proposed strategy results in
        fourfold improvements in signal-to-noise ratio, functional connectivity
        analysis with improved specificity, and valid statistical inference with
        nominal control of type 1 error in contrasts of connectivity between
        groups with different levels of subject motion.
