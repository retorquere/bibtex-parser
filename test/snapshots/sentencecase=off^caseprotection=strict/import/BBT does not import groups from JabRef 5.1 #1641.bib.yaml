        Power and social inequality shape patterns of land use and resource
        management. This book explores this relationship from different
        perspectives, illuminating the complexity of interactions between human
        societies and nature. Most of the contributors use the perspective of
        "political ecology" as a point of departure, recognizing that human
        relations to the environment and human social relations are not separate
        phenomena but inextricably intertwined. What makes this volume unique is
        that it sets this approach in a trans-disciplinary, global, and
        historical framework. Part 1: Theoretical Perspectives on Historical
        Political Ecology 1. Accumulation: Land as a Medium of Domination 2.
        Techno-Fix: Ecological Rifts and Capital Shifts 3. Empire: The
        Comparative Study of Imperialism 4. Islands: Ecologically Unequal

        Power and social inequality shape patterns of land use and resource
        management. This book explores this relationship from different
        perspectives, illuminating the complexity of interactions between human
        societies and nature. Most of the contributors use the perspective of
        "political ecology" as a point of departure, recognizing that human
        relations to the environment and human social relations are not separate
        phenomena but inextricably intertwined. What makes this volume unique is
        that it sets this approach in a trans-disciplinary, global, and
        historical framework. Part 1: Theoretical Perspectives on Historical

        Logic of Sense is one of Deleuze's seminal works. First published in
        1969, shortly after Difference and Repetition, it prefigures the hybrid
        style and methods he would use in his later writing with Felix Guattari.
        In an early review Michel Foucault wrote that Logic of Sense 'should be
        read as the boldest and most insolent of metaphysical treatises'. The
        book is divided into 34 'series' and five appendices covering a diverse
        range of topics including, sense, nonsense, event, sexuality,
        psychoanalysis, paradoxes, schizophrenia, literature and becoming and
        includes fascinating close textual readings of works by Lewis Carroll,
        Sigmund Freud, Seneca, Pierre Klossowski, F. Scott Fitzgerald, and Émile
        Zola. Logic of Sense is essential reading for anyone interested in
        post-war continental thought. Contents Preface: From Lewis Carroll to
        the Stoics First Series of Paradoxes of Pure Becoming Second Series of

        suffering, the fear of death, war, poverty, ecological destruction and
        social inequality: almost 2,000 ago Lucretius proposed an ethics of
        motion as simple and stunning solution to these ethical problems. Thomas
        Nail argues that Lucretius was the first to locate the core of all these
        ethical ills in our obsession with stasis, our fear of movement and our
        hatred of matter. Instead of trying to transcend nature with our minds,
        escape it with our immortal souls and dominate it with our technologies,
        Lucretius was perhaps the first in the Western tradition to forcefully
        argue for a completely materialist, immanent and naturalistic ethics
        based on moving well with and as nature. If we want to survive and live
        well on this planet, Lucretius taught us, our best chance is not to
        struggle against nature but to embrace it and facilitate its movement.
        Lucretius II is the second installment in Thomas Nail's transformative
        reading of Lucretius' didactic poem De Rerum Natura, which can be read
        individually or as a trilogy. Lucretius I covered books 1 and 2 of De
        Rerum Natura and looked at Lucretius' ontology; this volume covers books
        3 and 4 and Lucretius' ethics. The third and final volume will cover
        books 5 and 6.
