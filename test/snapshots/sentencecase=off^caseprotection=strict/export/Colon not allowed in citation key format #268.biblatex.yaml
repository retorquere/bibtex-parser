        This history of the books of Reading Abbey covers the period from the
        abbey's foundation to its dissolution, and also charts the dispersal of
        the book collections up until c.1610. It provides valuable evidence for
        intellectual life and the use of books in a medieval monastery. By
        continuing the story beyond the Dissolution of the Monasteries, and
        charting the initial stages of the dispersal of the Abbey's books (many
        into the large institutional collections which are their homes today),
        Alan Coates makes a valuable contribution to our understanding of the
        fate of monastic books and book-collecting in the second half of the
        sixteenth century.
