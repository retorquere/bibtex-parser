        Because they are not proper spectral modes, leaky modes do not obey the
        usual power orthogonality relations for an ideal waveguide. Two methods
        for circumventing this problem are presented in this paper. One approach
        is to use the fact that weakly leaky modes are approximately power
        orthogonal within a restricted region of space to define a new set of
        slightly coupled modes. The other is to abandon power orthogonality in
        favor of a more general, mathematically exact orthogonality relation.
        The relative merits of these two approaches are discussed.
