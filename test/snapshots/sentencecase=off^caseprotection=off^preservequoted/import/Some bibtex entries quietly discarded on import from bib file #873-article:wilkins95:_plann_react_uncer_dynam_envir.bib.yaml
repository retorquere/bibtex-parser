        Agents situated in dynamic and uncertain environments require several
        capabilities for successful operation. Such agents must monitor the
        world and respond appropriately to important events. The agents should
        be able to accept goals, synthesize complex plans for achieving those
        goals, and execute the plans while continuing to be responsive to
        changes in the world. As events render some current activities obsolete,
        the agents should be able to modify their plans while continuing
        activities unaffected by those events. The CYPRESS system is a
        domain-independent framework for defining persistent agents with this
        full range of behavior. CYPRESS has been used for several demanding
        applications, including military operations, real-time tracking, and
        fault diagnosis.
