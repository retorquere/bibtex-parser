        Cohen and Levesque critique KQML on three semantic grounds: ambiguity of
        specifications; misidentified performatives and performatives missing.
        The misidentified performatives are those that operate on other
        performatives where Cohen and Levesque argue that they should be
        operating directly on content. The major missing performative they
        identify is a commissive — the agreement to perform an action. They then
        propose that their logic of intention could be used to give a superior
        semantics. They conclude with some weak suggestions about the
        implications of this. Unfortunately, their semantics seem to be too
        “first principles-y” to be of much use to implementors. Finally, they
        say that extensibility and content independence are problems. It is hard
        to see how this is to be remedied.
