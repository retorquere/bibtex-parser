        Gives a summary of three-layer architectures for mobile robots. Gat's
        division into three layers is based on memory and algorithm run-time in
        the three layers: deliberation layer (top) allows algorithms with long
        latencies: several Behavior transitions can occur before one of these
        terminates. The middle layer is the sequencer, whose job it is to select
        primitive Behaviors, and supply parameters. The Sequencer is allowed to
        use algorithms with memory. At the bottom level is the Controller, which
        contains Behaviors, which should run one iteration in constant-bounded
        time and space, ideally being continuous in the input, and not using
        memory (although Gat makes exception for filters). Gat also argues that
        behaviors should fail cognizantly. This is interesting, because not what
        I would have expected because I'm either (a) a planning bigot or (b)
        realistic about the fact that one typically doesn't own an entire
        execution platform, depending on whether you're being (a) harsh or (b)
        kind. I tend to think that you are given the Controller (or at least a
        subset thereof), and that cognizant failure may be more than you can
        ask. Also the Sequencer is needed to provide a plan-cognizant layer
        above the Controller, which typically doesn't know anything about the
        context of its behaviors.
