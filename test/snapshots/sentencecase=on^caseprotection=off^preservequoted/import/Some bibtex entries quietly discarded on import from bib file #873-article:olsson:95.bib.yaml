        Describes the algorithm used by the ADATE system for learning Standard
        ML (subset) programs. The system is novel in concentrating on learning
        recursive programs and in being able to learn new imbedded functions.
        The paper was quite difficult to follow, since I didn't thoroughly
        understand the ML code...
