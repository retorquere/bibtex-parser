        We show that weak solutions of general conservation laws in bounded
        domains conserve their generalized entropy, and other respective
        companion laws, if they possess a certain fractional differentiability
        of order 1/3 in the interior of the domain, and if the normal component
        of the corresponding fluxes tend to zero as one approaches the boundary.
        This extends various recent results of the authors.
