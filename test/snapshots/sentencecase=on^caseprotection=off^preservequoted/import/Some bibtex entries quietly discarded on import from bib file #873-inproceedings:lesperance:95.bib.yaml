        The article provides an outline of the application of Scherl and
        Levesque's work on knowledge-producing actions and Reiter and Lin's work
        on the frame problem, to agent programming. The central limitation of
        the work is that they have little to say about the generation of new
        plans/programs for agent actions — they center their discussion around
        the use of the logic for verification of agent programs.
