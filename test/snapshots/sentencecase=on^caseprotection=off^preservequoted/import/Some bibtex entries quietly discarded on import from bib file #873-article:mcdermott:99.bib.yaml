        A more in-depth version of Drew's AIPS-96 paper, that described his
        search heuristic for forward planners. The article discusses the problem
        of “attention-deficit” in McDermott's UNPOP — the problem of switching
        between goals too much. Also discusses preservation goals, which we have
        just been kludging into SA-CIRCA.
