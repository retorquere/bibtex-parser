        A somewhat disappointing paper. The most difficult problem (credit where
        credit is due, this was identified by the authors) in having SHOP
        control other agents, is that in evaluating preconditions, SHOP must be
        able to project the effects of the actions of other agents. However,
        this very interesting engineering problem is just made the
        responsibility of the “monitoring agent” and left as an exercise for the
        reader.
