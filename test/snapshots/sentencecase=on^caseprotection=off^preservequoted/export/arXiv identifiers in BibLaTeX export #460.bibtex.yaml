        The development of small-scale digital and analog quantum devices raises
        the question of how to fairly assess and compare the computational power
        of classical and quantum devices, and of how to detect quantum speedup.
        Here we show how to define and measure quantum speedup in various
        scenarios, and how to avoid pitfalls that might mask or fake quantum
        speedup. We illustrate our discussion with data from a randomized
        benchmark test on a D-Wave Two device with up to 503 qubits. Comparing
        the performance of the device on random spin glass instances with
        limited precision to simulated classical and quantum annealers, we find
        no evidence of quantum speedup when the entire data set is considered,
        and obtain inconclusive results when comparing subsets of instances on
        an instance-by-instance basis. Our results for one particular benchmark
        do not rule out the possibility of speedup for other classes of problems
        and illustrate that quantum speedup is elusive and can depend on the
        question posed.

        A pair of recent articles concluded that the D-Wave One machine actually
        operates in the quantum regime, rather than performing some classical
        evolution. Here we give a classical model that leads to the same
        behaviors used in those works to infer quantum effects. Thus, the
        evidence presented does not demonstrate the presence of quantum effects.
