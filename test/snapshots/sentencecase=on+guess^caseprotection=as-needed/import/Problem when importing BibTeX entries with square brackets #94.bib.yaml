        Cluster model calculations have been carried out to study the electronic
        state and the chemical bonding in Cu2O and CuO as well as YBa2Cu3O7 and
        YBa2Cu3O6. The clusters used are Cu4O14-9, Cu4O16-12, Cu3O17-12 and
        Cu3O15-10, respectively, each being embedded in an appropriate
        electrostatic potential reflecting the crystal structure. The covalent
        interaction between Cu and O is most significant in the cluster for the
        high-temperature superconductor YBa2CuO7. It is remarkable that O 2p[pi]
        holes are created near the Fermi level and stabilized in the O—-Cu+—O-
        linear bond formed in the basal Cu2O plane of the cluster for YBa2Cu3O7.
        A charge disproportionation takes place both in the model clusters for
        YBa2Cu3O7 and YBa2Cu3O6, while a spin polarization is seen only in the
        latter. The similarity and dissimilarity of Cu atoms in those oxides are
        discussed.
