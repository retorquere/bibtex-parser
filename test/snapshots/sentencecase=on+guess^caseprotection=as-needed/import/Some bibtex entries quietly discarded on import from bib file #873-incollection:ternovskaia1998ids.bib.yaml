        We explore the situation calculus within the framework of inductive
        definability. A consequence of this view of the situation calculus is to
        establish direct connections with different variants of the mu-calculus,
        structural operational semantics of concurrent processes, and logic
        programming. First we show that the induction principle on situations is
        implied by an inductive definition of the set of situations. Then we
        consider the frame problem from the point of view of inductive
        definability and by defining fluents inductively we obtain essentially
        the same form of successor state axioms as Reiter's. Our approach allows
        extending this result to the case where ramification constraints are
        present. Finally we demonstrate a method of applying inductive
        definitions for computing fixed point properties of GOLOG programs.
