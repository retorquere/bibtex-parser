        The first step in any quantum key distribution (QKD) protocol consists
        of sequences of measurements that produce correlated classical data. We
        show that these correlation data must violate some Bell inequality in
        order to contain distillable secrecy, if not they could be produced by
        quantum measurements performed on a separable state of larger dimension.
        We introduce a new QKD protocol and prove its security against any
        individual attack by an adversary only limited by the no-signaling
        condition.
