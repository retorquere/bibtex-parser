        The results of a close-coupling calculation of the fine-structure
        transitions (j,mj→j',m'j) are presented for collisions between photons
        and F(Pj,mj2). The theory is formulated in the
        perturbed-stationary-state approximation using accurate molecular wave
        functions for the ground II2 and Σ2 states of HF+. Comparison is made to
        the predictions of the Born approximation. The magnetic selection rule
        (j,mj→j,-mj) is strongly violated in the j=32 state and less strongly
        violated in the j=12 state. It is concluded that the important region of
        interaction for the j=12→j=32 transition is at short-to-intermediate
        distances where accurate molecular potentials are required and
        close-coupling effects are dominant.
