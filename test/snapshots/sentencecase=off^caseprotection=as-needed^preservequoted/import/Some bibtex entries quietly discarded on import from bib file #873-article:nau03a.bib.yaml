        The SHOP2 planning system received one of the awards for distinguished
        performance in the 2002 International Planning Competition. This paper
        describes the features of SHOP2 which enabled it to excel in the
        competition, especially those aspects of SHOP2 that deal with temporal
        and metric planning domains.
