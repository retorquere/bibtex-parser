        LDS is a search technique that iteratively makes n decisions differently
        from the dictates of its heuristic, for increasing n. The intuition
        behind LDS is that heuristics often give recommendations that are worse
        at the start of the search than at the end. Accordingly, LDS makes
        divergent decisions initially at the beginning of the search path,
        working towards the end. Note that were this assumption wrong,
        depth-first search would work well, because it undoes decisions first at
        the end of the search. Harvey and Ginsberg also discuss combining LDS
        with bounded-backtrack search, which they show gives better behavior in
        large search spaces.
