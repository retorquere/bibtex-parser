        Baker discusses ways in which dynamic backtracking can behave
        exponentially worse than simpler approaches, in particular depth-first
        search and backjumping. Briefly, the intuition is that in the attempt to
        preserve work done through backtracking, dynamic backtracking often
        preserves constraints propagated from value choices that have since been
        retracted, confining it in bad parts of the search space.
