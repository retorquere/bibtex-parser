        Description Logics are a family of knowledge representation languages
        that have been studied extensively in Artificial Intelligence over the
        last two decades. They are embodied in several knowledge-based systems
        and are used to develop various real-life applications. The Description
        Logic Handbook provides a thorough account of the subject, covering all
        aspects of research in this field, namely: theory, implementation, and
        applications. Its appeal will be broad, ranging from more
        theoretically-oriented readers, to those with more practically-oriented
        interests who need a sound and modern understanding of knowledge
        representation systems based on Description Logics. The chapters are
        written by some of the most prominent researchers in the field,
        introducing the basic technical material before taking the reader to the
        current state of the subject, and including comprehensive guides to the
        literature. In sum, the book will serve as a unique reference for the
        subject, and can also be used for self-study or in conjunction with
        Knowledge Representation and Artificial Intelligence courses.
