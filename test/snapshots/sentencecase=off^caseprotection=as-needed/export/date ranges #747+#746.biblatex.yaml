        Virtually all ITS applications rely on accurate traffic data.
        Identification of faulty detectors is thus vital for their reliability
        and efficiency. Most existing approaches solely use current and
        historical data of single or adjacent detectors and are based on
        empirical thresholds. We present a method for fault detection using
        Floating-Car Data (FCD) as independent source of information which
        allows to distinguish changed traffic conditions from sensor faults.
        Fault detection is based on residuals of a nonlinear regression model
        fitted to detector readings and FCD traffic speeds. Instead of applying
        rule-of-thumb thresholds we employ a statistical test, where thresholds
        result naturally from historical data, sample sizes and required fault
        detection accuracy. We provide a theoretical framework for fault
        detectability analysis and empirically evaluate the fault detection
        capability of our approach using data obtained from a microscopic
        traffic simulation.

        In designing computer-based systems, we work within a perspective that
        shapes the design questions that will be asked and the kinds of
        solutions that are sought. This paper introduces a perspective based on
        language as action, and explores its consequences for practical system
        design. The language/action perspective is contrasted to a number of
        other currently prominent perspectives, and is illustrated with an
        extended example based on studies of nursing work in a hospital ward. We
        show how it leads to particular analyses of that work, which reveal
        potentials for creating new designs that can make the work (and the
        workers) more effective.
