          Project is trying to find a path through a state-space automaton.
          Deliberation scheduling in this framework is the allocation of
          resources between \emph{policy generation} for a subgraph of the
          overall automaton and \emph{envelope expansion} to consider a
          larger subset of the state space.  Compares
          \emph{precursor-deliberation}, where you develop the whole policy
          before any execution, and \emph{recurrent-deliberation}, where the
          agent repeatedly replans.}
