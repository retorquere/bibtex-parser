        The authors review Chapman's Modal Truth Criterion (MTC) from his paper
        “Planning for Conjunctive Goals.” They show a bug in Chapman's arguments
        — in particular that the equivalence ◇p≡¬□¬p doesn't hold for truth in
        partially-ordered plans. The reason for this is that the excluded middle
        does not hold in the logic of partial plans — the truth value of some p
        in some completion of a partial plan may not be defined, because the
        completion may be ill-formed.
