        Gene expression in a tissue-specific context depends on the combined
        efforts of epigenetic, transcriptional and post-transcriptional
        processes that lead to the production of specific proteins that are
        important determinants of cellular identity. Ribosomes are a central
        component of the protein biosynthesis machinery in cells; however, their
        regulatory roles in the translational control of gene expression in
        skeletal muscle remain to be defined. In a genetic screen to identify
        critical regulators of myogenesis, we identified a DEAD-Box RNA
        helicase, DDX27, that is required for skeletal muscle growth and
        regeneration. We demonstrate that DDX27 regulates ribosomal RNA (rRNA)
        maturation, and thereby the ribosome biogenesis and the translation of
        specific transcripts during myogenesis. These findings provide insight
        into the translational regulation of gene expression in myogenesis and
        suggest novel functions for ribosomes in regulating gene expression in
        skeletal muscles.

        Centronuclear myopathies (CNM) are a subtype of congenital myopathies
        (CM) characterized by skeletal muscle weakness and an increase in the
        number of central myonuclei. We have previously identified three CNM
        probands, two with associated dilated cardiomyopathy, carrying striated
        preferentially expressed gene (SPEG) mutations. Currently, the role of
        SPEG in skeletal muscle function is unclear as constitutive
        SPEG-deficient mice developed severe dilated cardiomyopathy and died in
        utero. We have generated a conditional Speg-KO mouse model and excised
        Speg by crosses with striated muscle-specific cre-expressing mice
        (MCK-Cre). The resulting litters had a delay in Speg excision consistent
        with cre expression starting in early postnatal life and, therefore, an
        extended lifespan up to a few months. KO mice were significantly smaller
        and weaker than their littermate-matched controls. Histopathological
        skeletal muscle analysis revealed smaller myofibers, marked fiber-size
        variability, and poor integrity and low number of triads. Further,
        SPEG-deficient muscle fibers were weaker by physiological and in vitro
        studies and exhibited abnormal Ca2+ handling and excitation-contraction
        (E-C) coupling. Overall, SPEG deficiency in skeletal muscle is
        associated with fewer and abnormal triads, and defective calcium
        handling and excitation-contraction coupling, suggesting that therapies
        targeting calcium signaling may be beneficial in such patients.
