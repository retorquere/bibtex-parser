        Wow! A paper containing the germs of a vast amount of other work.
        Explains how <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Strips</span> plans
        are to be executed, stored, and reused. The key to all of these
        techniques are the <i>triangle tables</i>, which are a limited form of
        explanation-based learning. They also underly the approach to execution
        monitoring. For the plan monitoring, the triangle table contains a
        cached out representation of the preconditions necessary for execution
        of each plan suffix. So the executor monitors the truth of each of these
        preconditions, allowing it both to re-execute failed prefixes and
        exploit opportunities to skip steps.
