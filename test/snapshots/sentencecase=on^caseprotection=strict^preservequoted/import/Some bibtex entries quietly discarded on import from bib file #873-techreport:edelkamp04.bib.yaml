        This document defines the language to be used in the classical part of
        the 4th International Planning Competition, IPC-4. The language
        comprises all of PDDL2.1 levels 1, 2, and 3, as defined by Maria Fox and
        Derek Long in fox:long:jair-03; parts of this document have been copied
        from that source. On top of this language, for IPC-4 <i>derived
        predicates</i> are re-introduced, and <i>timed initial literals</i> are
        (newly) introduced into the competition language. We give the syntax and
        semantics of these constructs.
