        Modern strategic planning systems increasingly confront two
        difficulties: strategic information about impending threats and
        opportunities is perceived too late to permit timely and effective
        response; and the corporate planning cycle is too long to permit timely
        response to fast-developing events. In response to the first difficulty,
        the author develops a technique for early identification of early
        strategic signals and a method for matching the firm's response to the
        quality of information. In response to the second problem, a real time
        planning system, called strategic issue management, is developed.
