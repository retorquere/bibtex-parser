        Recently, Beullens, Kleinjung, and Vercauteren (Asiacrypt’19) provided
        the first practical isogeny-based digital signature, obtained from the
        Fiat-Shamir (FS) paradigm. They worked with the CSIDH-512 parameters and
        passed through a new record class group computation. However, as with
        all standard FS signatures, the security proof is highly non-tight and
        the concrete parameters are set under the heuristic that the only way to
        attack the scheme is by finding collisions for a hash function.In this
        paper, we propose an FS-style signature scheme, called Lossy CSI-FiSh,
        constructed using the CSIDH-512 parameters and with a security proof
        based on the “Lossy Keys” technique introduced by Kiltz, Lyubashevsky
        and Schaffner (Eurocrypt’18). Lossy CSI-FiSh is provably secure under
        the same assumption which underlies the security of the key exchange
        protocol CSIDH (Castryck et al. (Asiacrypt’18)) and is almost as
        efficient as CSI-FiSh. For instance, aiming for small signature size,
        our scheme is expected to take around \approx 800≈800\approx 800 ms to
        sign/verify while producing signatures of size \approx 280≈280\approx
        280 bytes. This is only twice slower than CSI-FiSh while having similar
        signature size for the same parameter set. As an additional benefit, our
        scheme is by construction secure both in the classical and quantum
        random oracle model.

        We present the first general-purpose digital signature scheme based on
        supersingular elliptic curve isogenies secure against quantum
        adversaries in the quantum random oracle model with small key sizes.
        This scheme is an application of Unruh’s construction of non-interactive
        zero-knowledge proofs to an interactive zero-knowledge proof proposed by
        De Feo, Jao, and Plût. We implement our proposed scheme on an x86-64 PC
        platform as well as an ARM-powered device. We exploit the
        state-of-the-art techniques to speed up the computations for general C
        and assembly. Finally, we provide timing results for real world
        applications.
