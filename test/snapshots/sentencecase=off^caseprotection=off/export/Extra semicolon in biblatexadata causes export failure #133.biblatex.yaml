      abstract: "This paper is devoted to a new regularization method for solving the\P numerical analytic continuation of an analytic function f(z) = f(x +\P iy) on a strip domain Omega(+) = {z = x + iy is an element of C\P vertical bar x is an element of R, 0 < y < y(0)}, where the data is\P given approximately only on the line y = 0. This problem is severely\P ill-posed and has important practical applications. The theoretical\P optimal error bound for the problem is proved which is independent of\P the selected regularization methods. A modified Tikhonov regularization\P method with asymptotic order optimal error estimates is proposed. This\P method can be numerically implemented easily by the fast Fourier\P transform. Some numerical examples are provided and a comparison with a\P Fourier regularization method is given, which show the modified\P Tikhonov method works very well."
