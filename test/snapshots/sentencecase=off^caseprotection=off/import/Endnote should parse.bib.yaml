        There are still no effective treatments to prevent, halt, or reverse
        Alzheimer's disease, but research advances over the past three decades
        could change this gloomy picture. Genetic studies demonstrate that the
        disease has multiple causes. Interdisciplinary approaches combining
        biochemistry, molecular and cell biology, and transgenic modeling have
        revealed some of its molecular mechanisms. Progress in chemistry,
        radiology, and systems biology is beginning to provide useful
        biomarkers, and the emergence of personalized medicine is poised to
        transform pharmaceutical development and clinical trials. However,
        investigative and drug development efforts should be diversified to
        fully address the multifactoriality of the disease.
