        The Act formalism provides a medium in which to express knowledge about
        actions for both the SIPE-2 plan generation system and the PRS plan
        execution system. This document describes the Act-Editor, which provides
        a graphical user interface for creating and manipulating Acts. The
        document is designed for individuals who are already familiar with the
        Act formalism. The Act-Editor runs on Sun workstations with either
        Allegro Common Lisp 4.2/4.3 with CLIM 2.0/2.1, or Lucid Lisp 4.1 with
        CLIM 1.1., as well as Symbolics Lisp Machines.
