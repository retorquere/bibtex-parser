        Hierarchical Task Network (HTN) planning (Sacerdoti 1974) is an approach
        to planning where problem-specific knowledge is used to remedy the
        computational intractability of classical planning. This knowledge is in
        the form of task decomposition directives, i.e. the planner is given a
        set of methods that tell it how a high-level task can be decomposed into
        lower-level tasks. The HTN planning problem consists in computing a
        sequence of primitive tasks that corresponds to performing the initial
        set of high-level tasks. Our purpose in this prthis paper is 1) to give
        an account of HTNplanning as high-level programming in the situation
        calculus (McCarthy 1963) based languages Golog/ConGolog (Levesque et al.
        1997; De Giacomo, Lesperance, & Levesque 2000) and 2) to illustrate our
        approach with a ConGolog encoding of a logistics domain HTN-planning
        problem. The Golog/ConGolog languages have been extended to deal with
        explicit time, sensing actions, exogenous events, execution monitoring,
        incomplete knowledge of the initial state, stochastic actions and
        others. Thus the range of problems that can be tackled with this
        approach is potentially much larger. As an example, we modified the
        logistics domain encoding to execute on-line and deal with run-time
        exogenous delivery requests
