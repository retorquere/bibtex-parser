        As the name suggests, presents a sound and complete algorithm for HTN
        planning. The accomplishment is less overwhelming than it might at first
        seem, because the HTN plan's semantics rests on STRIPS-style world
        updates. So an HTN planner constructed according to this method will
        have the same knowledge-engineering demands as a first-principles STRIPS
        planner.
