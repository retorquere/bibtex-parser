        SHOP (Simple Hierarchical Ordered Planner) is a domain-independent HTN
        Planning system with the following characteristics. * SHOP plans for
        tasks in the same order that they will later be executed. This avoids
        some of the goal-interaction issues that arise in other HTN planners,
        thus making the planning algorithm relatively simple. * The planning
        algorithm is sound and complete over a large class of problems. * Since
        SHOP knows the complete world-state at each step of the planning
        process, it can use highly expressive domain representations. For
        example, it can do planning problems that require complex numeric
        computations. * In our tests, SHOP solved problems several orders of
        magnitude faster than Blackbox and TLplan. This occured even though SHOP
        is written in Lisp and the other planners are written in C. (Also
