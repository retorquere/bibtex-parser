  abstract     = {Infants use {\textquotedblleft}unexpectedness{\textquotedblright} as a \textquotedbl{}cue\textquotedbl{} for learning. Stahl and Feigenson studied how babies reacted when objects behaved in surprising ways (see the Perspective by Schulz). Babies who saw apparently solid and weighty objects moving through a wall or past the edge of a table without falling looked intently at them. When given the opportunity to explore these peculiar objects, they did so by banging them on the floor{\textemdash}as if to test their solidity{\textemdash}or dropping them{\textemdash}as if to test their weightiness.},
