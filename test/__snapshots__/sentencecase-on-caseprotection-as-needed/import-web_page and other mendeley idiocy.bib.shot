          "The purpose of this research was to investigate the relationship of fiction exposure and individual differences in morally relevant traits such as empathy, moral identity, and moral agency. Results from Study 1 were used to form hypotheses and specify statistical models for a preregistered second study. Relationships between moral constructs and three measures of fiction exposure (adult and young adult [YA] fiction and nonfiction) were tested with structural equation models (controlling for personality and gender). Associations between YA fiction and empathic concern, integrity, and moral agency were consistent across studies, as was that between adult fiction and moral permissibility. In line with theories of empathic simulation, empathy fully mediated the association between YA fiction and the sense of moral self. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)",

          "When selecting and evaluating historical children's literature, there are many questions that must be considered. For example, who will be reading the book? Is the imagined young reader of these historical stories a White, middle class cisgender heterosexual, able-bodied student who was born in the United States, or are child readers from all backgrounds being kept in mind. What kind of story is being told in the book? What makes the story difficult? Who is it difficult for? Does the nature of that difficulty differ depending on the demographic makeup of a classroom, school or community? None of these questions are new. Because problematic depictions of children continue to be published, reading and English language arts teachers in classrooms all over the United States, as well as the literacy educators who prepare them, must critically consider these questions as they select books for their students. As children read historical fiction, they are also learning about our nation's fraught past. Many historical topics found in children's and young adult literature–slavery, conditions in the Jim Crow South, the Japanese internment camps of World War II, and the genocide of Native Americans, to name just a few–are set amid the incomprehensible horrors of the bleakest chapters of American history. As literary critic Clare Bradford (2007) noted, one of the functions of children's literature is \\"to explain and interpret national histories–histories that involve invasion, conquest, violence, and assimilation\\" (p. 97). Addressing these fraught events, however, can prove difficult in light of some of the other functions of children's literature in our culture: to transmit values, to convey a sense of nostalgia and wonder, to spark young imaginations, or to provide an expected \\"happily ever after\\" at the end of each story. Racial issues raised during studying literature can cause considerable discomfort to both teachers and students. This is especially true of African American children's literature. Therefore, the authors of this article recommend that even when using award winning African American children's literature about slavery, recent research recommendations for learning and teaching African American children's literature should be consulted prior to approaching units on slavery. The authors offer a 5-point criteria by Rudine Sims Bishop for helping teachers, parents, and community members choose appropriate books depicting slavery. The 5 principles provided here for selecting authentic children's literature about slavery have the potential to expand the depiction of the lives of the enslaved beyond bondage. Using Bishop's framework to evaluate \\"A Fine Dessert,\\" this article provides a recommended list of children's books that depict enslaved characters that are within the literary tradition that Bishop delineated.",

          "Public opinion, as necessary a concept it is to the underpinnings of democracy, is a socially constructed representation of the public that is forged by the methods and data from which it is derived, as well as how it is understood by those tasked with evaluating and utilizing it. I examine how social media manifests as public opinion in the news and how these practices shape journalistic routines. I draw from a content analysis of news stories about the 2016 US election, as well as interviews with journalists, to shed light on evolving practices that inform the use of social media to represent public opinion. I find that despite social media users not reflecting the electorate, the press reported online sentiments and trends as a form of public opinion that services the horserace narrative and complements survey polling and vox populi quotes. These practices are woven into professional routines – journalists looked to social media to reflect public opinion, especially in the...",

This study will present an analysis of the two translations of The Black Book, taking as its point of departure the criticism expressed in the reviews. The analysis will reveal the ways in which the first translation served as a criterion for the retranslation and how the two translators represented the author and his work differently, which was mainly enabled because of the changing status of Orhan Pamuk as an author in the English-speaking world between 1994 and 2006.",

          "\\"A significant body of scholarship examines the production of children's literature by women and minorities, as well as the representation of gender, race, and sexuality. But few scholars have previously analyzed class in children's literature. This definitive collection remedies that by defining and exemplifying historical materialist approaches to children's literature. The introduction of Little Red Readings lucidly discusses characteristics of historical materialism, the methodological approach to the study of literature and culture first outlined by Karl Marx, defining key concepts and analyzing factors that have marginalized this tradition, particularly in the United States. The thirteen essays here analyze a wide range of texts–from children's bibles to Mary Poppins to The Hunger Games–using concepts in historical materialism from class struggle to the commodity. Essayists apply the work of Marxist theorists such as Ernst Bloch and Fredric Jameson to children's literature and film. Others examine the work of leftist writers in India, Germany, England, and the United States. The authors argue that historical materialist methodology is critical to the study of children's literature, as children often suffer most from inequality. Some of the critics in this collection reveal the ways that literature for children often functions to naturalize capitalist economic and social relations. Other critics champion literature that reveals to readers the construction of social reality and point to texts that enable an understanding of the role ordinary people might play in creating a more just future. The collection adds substantially to our understanding of the political and class character of children's literature worldwide, and contributes to the development of a radical history of children's literature\\"–",

          "Wikipedia advocates a strict 'neutral point of view' (NPOV) policy. However, although originally a U.S-based, English-language phenomenon, the online, user-created encyclopedia now has versions in many languages. This study examines the extent to which content and perspectives vary across cultures by comparing articles about famous persons in the Polish and English editions of Wikipedia. The results of quantitative and qualitative content analyses reveal systematic differences related to the different cultures, histories, and values of Poland and the United States; at the same time, a U.S./English-language advantage is evident throughout. In conclusion, the implications of these findings for the quality and objectivity of Wikipedia as a global repository of knowledge are discussed, and recommendations are advanced for Wikipedia end users and content developers.

          "\\"Over the past decade, Jeffrey J. Williams has been one of the most perceptive observers of contemporary literary and cultural studies. He has also been a shrewd analyst of the state of American higher education. How to Be an Intellectual brings together noted and new essays and exemplifies Williams's effort to bring criticism to a wider public How to Be an Intellectual profiles a number of critics, drawing on a unique series of interviews that give an inside look at their work and careers. The book often looks at critical thought from surprising angles, examining, for instance, the history of modern American criticism in terms of its keywords as they morphed from sound to rigorous to smart. It also puts in plain language the political travesty of higher education policies that produce student debt, which, as Williams demonstrates, all too readily follow the model of colonial indenture, not just as a metaphor but in actual point of fact. How to Be an Intellectual tells a story of intellectual life since the culture wars. Shedding academic obscurity and calling for a better critical writing, it reflects on what makes the critic and intellectual the accidents of careers, the trends in thought, the institutions that shape us, and politics. It also includes personal views of living and working with books\\"–",

However, few studies explore how teenagers as a distinct user group are engaged in Participatory Design activities. Based on a case study comprising ten Participatory Design workshops with teenagers (13-15 years old), we identified a range of tools that designers employed in order to engage the teenagers actively in Participatory Design: rewards, storytelling, identification, collaboration, endorsement, technology, and performance. Although these tools were realized through the use of well-established Participatory Design methods and techniques, a deeper understanding of teenagers' motivation and motives is essential to understanding how tools and techniques may be made to support teenagers' motivation. We propose a Cultural-Historical Activity Theory approach to teenagers' motives and motivation as a framework for understanding how various tools may be employed to engage teenagers in Participatory Design activities.",

Ranging in time from the Renaissance to the era of digital publishing, the essays invite us to reconsider the influential theories of Roland Barthes, Michel Foucault, and Pierre Bourdieu for our understanding of writers such as Philip Sidney, Thomas Hardy, Laura Riding, W.B. Yeats, Gertrude Stein, and J.M. Coetzee. Shedding new light on authority’s complex role in the generation of cultural meaning, the essays will be of interest to students and teachers of literary history and critical theory alike.",

          "This reflexive ethnography looks closely at what motivates and empowers a group of six white teachers to challenge the status quo and address racism and white privilege in their classrooms and the school. Most previous research on anti-racist pedagogy has focused on preservice teachers and educators involved in university courses or anti-racism training workshops. Few studies have looked at how veteran teachers can voluntarily work together to challenge racism within themselves and their students. In this study five white women teachers in a predominantly white suburban elementary school in central New York voluntarily came together with the author, who is also a teacher in the same school, to form an anti-racism study group. Using a participatory action research framework, the group - four classroom teachers, the librarian, and the author, read about, discussed and reflected upon the meaning of race, racism, and white privilege through study group meetings and a series of active dialogues with the author. Participants' personal biographies revealed previous experiences with racial issues, which had influenced the adoption of social justice perspectives. Despite this, the group struggled to come to terms with an uncritical acceptance of white privilege, racial stereotyping, and the myth of equal opportunity. The group evaluated children's literature that might be used to develop an anti- racism curriculum that met the needs of both the white students and the small number of students of color in their classrooms. Based on this work, the classroom teachers developed and carried out their own classroom research projects using one or more pieces of children's literature. This study shows that veteran teachers working voluntarily can come together to critically examine the issues of racism and privilege, and to work at deconstructing reality and the institutions of which they are part. It also demonstrates the power of participant action research in which teachers carry out and share their classroom studies with their co-participants as an effective way to make substantive changes in the way they teach their students, and in the anti-racism activism they pursue in their personal lives.",

          "The literary status of writers is strongly dependent on the critical attention given to their books in the daily and weekly press. Previous research has shown that this attention depends to a great extent on attributes that are external to the work in question, but are related to its institutional setting, notably the stature of the publisher and the critical reception of previous works by the same author. This article considers the options writers have at their disposal to stimulate or hold the interest of the critics. Following a theoretical outline of the types of activities authors can engage in, an analysis is performed on the relationship between 279 writers' involvement in a number of ‘sideline’ activities in the Dutch literary world and the degree of critical interest in the books of these writers. Both the versatility of the authors' performance in the literary world and the extent to which they were involved in prominent institutions proved to have...",

          "This article responds to Marzia Milazzo's article ‘On white ignorance, white shame, and other pitfalls in critical philosophy of race’ (2017), in which Milazzo argues that the concepts white shame, white guilt, white privilege, white habits, white invisibility and white ignorance are pitfalls in the process of decolonisation. Milazzo contends that the way these concepts are theorised in much critical philosophy of race minimises white people's active interest in reproducing the racial status quo. While I agree with Milazzo's critique of white shame and white guilt, I argue that these affective responses are fundamentally different to the remaining concepts. Drawing on critical whiteness studies and agnotology, I argue that white privilege, white invisibility and white ignorance are valuable conceptual tools for revealing (as opposed to minimising) white people's active investment in maintaining racial inequality. Whereas Milazzo sees a contradiction between white people's active interest in maintaining racial inequality and concepts like white invisibility and white ignorance, I argue that, correctly theorised, these concepts resolve this apparent contradiction. I contest Milazzo's call to reject white privilege, white invisibility and white ignorance, arguing that these concepts are useful tools in the project of decolonisation.",

          "This article examines Samantha Vice's essay ‘How Do I Live in This Strange Place?’ (2010), which sparked a storm of controversy in South Africa, as a starting point for interrogating understandings of whiteness and racism that are dominant in critical philosophy of race. I argue that a significant body of philosophical scholarship on whiteness in general and by white scholars in particular obfuscates the structural dimension of racism. The moralisation of racism that often permeates philosophical scholarship reproduces colourblind logics, which provide individualistic explanations for structural problems, thereby sustaining white dominance. In the process, I show that notions of white guilt, white habits, white ignorance, white invisibility, white privilege, and white shame as they are theorised in much critical philosophy of race share a crucial limitation: they minimise white people's active interest in reproducing the racist status quo. Studies, such as Vice's, that frame racism as a moral dilemma while silencing its institutionalisation and the central cause for its existence and longevity – that is, white people's investment in maintaining economic, political, and symbolic power – further naturalise white supremacy.",

          "Literacy and learning is a social process, one that is both transformative, empowering, and can often lead to social change. The following study is based on the idea that literacy can be used as a tool not only to teach the basic skills of reading, but the skills for individuals to learn to be compassionate towards others, understand their individuality, and envision how their self can alter their community for a more just world. The frameworks that support these concepts are socio-cultural theory, reader response theory, and critical literacy theory. The intersection of these three theories highlight the importance of the reader as an active learner, while recognizing the influences of the social context and how it impacts literature discussions concerning issues of equity, justice, and empathy towards others. Within this critical ethnographic case study, I explored how students in an elementary classroom create meaning and respond to literature among their peers and how their perceptions and conceptions about their self and world change. The following dissertation begins with Chapter 1, highlighting the basic background information of the research and the study. Chapter 2 develops a framework, as mentioned, discussing the intersection between socio-cultural theory, reader response theory, and critical literacy. Chapter 3 outlines the details and central components of the critical ethnographic case study. Chapter 4 delves into the findings of this case study. Finally, Chapter 5 concludes the dissertation including summary of results, implications, limitations, and future research. Through this investigation, I hope to extend the existing research and knowledge on how to provide a cooperative literary community that is transformative and empowering for young children.",

We describe the experiential sessions that we facilitated as all-day institutes at the White Privilege Conference (WPC) beginning in 2008 and continuing to the upcoming conference in 2012. The purpose of our experiential institute is to give white people an opportunity to learn about critical humility. The purpose of this paper is to provide enough information about each experiential activity in the institute so that others can use our work for their own purposes.",

          "Stereotypes yield maps of distinction that people draw from and apply in interaction. Because these distinctions are hierarchically differentiated, stereotypes are racially unequal. But in what ways? Drawing from primary data, I first show how stereotypes disproportionately characterize some groups positively and others negatively. In particular, white stereotypes entail many more positive connotations, while nonwhite stereotypes entail many more negative connotations. A second point I raise is how white stereotypes are more nuanced and complex compared to other groups’ stereotypes. That is, nonwhite stereotypes are more one-dimensional, singular, and monolithic compared to white stereotypes, which are more three-dimensional, plural, and contradictory. Following my analysis, I address what implications this has for the broader context of racial equity. Stereotypes merit analytic attention because they can, and often do, have self-fulfilling prophesies. Though interaction, they are often acted upon and become real in their consequences. When stereotypes are racially unequal, the status quo of white privilege is preserved and a racially just world remains out of reach.",

          "To effectively deliver racially just projects, we must theoretically understand from where emotional resistance to them stems, why this resistance is regularly expressed, and what role they play in stifling antiracism. This theoretical paper examines how emotional investment in whiteness recycles normative behaviors of white resistance and unveils how they painfully reinforce the supremacy of whiteness. Using a black feminist approach to emotionality and an interdisciplinary approach to critical whiteness studies and critical race theory, this paper begins with positing how the emotions of white resistance are rooted in the shame of revealing a repressed childhood racial abuse. The concern is twofold. First, what happens to the child, now grown, when confronted with moments that reveal this repressed traumatic past? Secondly, how do these emotional outbursts, regardless of whether they are intentional or malicious, continue to silence, racially-microaggress, and ultimately hurt people of color? Methodologically, this paper employs counterstorytelling to illustrate how these emotional behaviors force an interconnected process of pain – one that gets erroneously projected onto people of color rather than therapeutically onto the self. When whites refuse to project their racial shame onto people of color they emotionally invest in a therapy out of whiteness.",

Next, I will discuss symbolic resources as a way to link one’s imagination with another’s. Qualitative interviews from The Harry Potter Alliance will be examined as a case where collective action is taken through shared resources. It will highlight how placing real-world issues in dialogue with imaginary constructs can assist in sharing imaginations toward worlds of what-if. Discussions around the relational aspect of collective imagination will end the paper.",

Although social scientists tell stories under the guise of ?objective? research, these stories actually uphold deficit, racialized notions about people of color. For the authors, a critical race methodology provides a tool to ?counter? deficit storytelling. Specifically, a critical race methodology offers space to conduct and present research grounded in the experiences and knowledge of people of color. As they describe how they compose counter-stories, the authors discuss how the stories can be used as theoretical, methodological, and pedagogical tools to challenge racism, sexism, and classism and work toward social justice.",

          "As educators who teach antiracism education, we seek to interrupt relations of racial inequity by enabling students to identify, name, and challenge the norms, patterns, traditions, structures, and institutions that hold racism and White supremacy in place. In this article, we share three strategies that we have developed out of our own practice as white educators who work in university and community settings, and which have been effective in our antiracism education efforts: The first we call Silence Breakers. This strategy addresses common fears that keep participants – and white participants in particular – on the sidelines in race discussions and in doing so prevent them from engagement; The second are analogies we have developed to help students conceptualize antiracism as a lens of inquiry rather than as something they have to agree or disagree with; And the third strategy are vignettes which are in essence stories that students can relate to but that are not as politically charged as explicit discussions of racism can be. Because they put the student in the protagonist position, these vignettes can unsettle expectations, reduce tensions, and evoke curiosity.",

          "This conceptual essay explores the idea of negotiating race-related tensions through the lens of critical Whiteness and antiracism theory. Introducing the concept of thoughtful inaction in relation to White privilege and antiracist work, the essay examines what it means not to act and the consequences of such inaction. Current ways of thinking related to diversity, equity, and inclusion and how mindsets are manifest into (in)action will be investigated, along with barriers confronted when attempting to maintain and facilitate antiracist dispositions and actions in sociopolitical contexts. The author emphasizes conceptualizations of antiracism and argues the benefit in framing antiracist development to better contextualize personal understanding and encourage growth in relation to one’s own racial identity development.",

Fish claims that his Affective Stylistics is only a descriptive method, and he disavows any evaluative potential for its description of the structure of the reader's response. However, on several levels Affective Stylistics contains implicit values: definitional, prescriptive, comparative, and ethical. Therefore, an evaluative tendency is inherent in the method. In fact, an examination of the premises and practice of Affective Stylistics shows that disorientation during the reading process is seen as both a literary and an ethical criterion of evaluation. This disorientation is valued because of its consequences for the reader's growth (the ultimate concern of Affective Stylistics). Far from being the evaluatively-neutral methodology that Fish claims, Affective Stylistics is a moral approach to literature in and of itself.",

We first explain how we came to this work as education scholars trained to examine systemic racism in educational institutions. We then explain the steps we have taken to pursue our current study that examines the portrayal of Latinx in children's literature. First, we describe an online library catalog platform that we have created to catalog a book collection of over 300 books by/about Latinx people published in the United States during a five-year period from 2011 to 2015. Next, we outline our understanding of two prevalent research approaches in critical analyses of children and youth literature, Critical Multicultural Analysis (CMA) and CCA. We then explain CRT in education and its tenets. Finally, we explain how the tenets of CRT can be applied to a CCA. We provide a set of guidelines for researchers to use in their own critical race analyses of children’s literature and use an example of how these guidelines are applied.",

          "The global teen market has significant spending power and an important impact on the world economy. However, much remains unknown about the social motivations of teenage consumers and cross-national cultural differences in teenage shopping. This research studies teenage shopping motivations in two nations: the U.S., which is a highly individualistic national culture with low power distance and low uncertainty avoidance, and France, which is perhaps a somewhat more collectivist, more inter-dependent national culture with high power distance and high uncertainty avoidance. This research samples 570 teenage consumers. Susceptibility to peer influence (SPI) drives teenage consumer shopping in France, while both need for uniqueness (NFU) and SPI motivate teenage shopping in the U.S.",

His witty and acerbic attacks on contemporary culture and society are read and enjoyed by many, and his studies of literature are regarded as classics of contemporary criticism. In this new edition of his groundbreaking treatise on literary theory, Eagleton seeks to develop a sophisticated relationship between Marxism and literary criticism. Ranging across the key works of Raymond Williams, Lenin, Trotsky, Brecht, Adorno, Benjamin, Lukacs and Sartre, he develops a nuanced critique of traditional literary criticism while producing a compelling theoretical account of ideology. Eagleton uses this perspective to offer fascinating analyses of canonical writers, including George Eliot, Charles Dickens, Joseph Conrad, Henry James, T.S. Eliot, W.B. Yeats, James Joyce and D.H. Lawrence. The new introduction sets this classic book in the context of its first appearance and Eagleton provides illuminating reflections on the progress of literary study over the years.",

My aim is twofold: first, to kickstart the process of clarifying what we mean to talk about when we talk about diverse books and, second, to demonstrate how the LIS classroom can serve as a resource for populating the conceptual imagination.",

This piece notes that in the 30years since Stuart Hall published his seminal essay, \\"Notes on Deconstructing the Popular,\\" the power relations that define the term as well as the way in which scholars study the popular have shifted in profound ways. The authors argue that, rather than simply equating the popular with popular culture, it is necessary to recognize that the popular is a contingent term that marks the possibility of constituting forms of collective agency and the potential for bringing about social and political change.

          "What exactly is a children’s book? How is children’s literature defined as a genre? A leading scholar presents close readings of six classic stories to answer these questions and offer a clear definition of children’s writing as a distinct literary form. Perry Nodelman begins by considering the plots, themes, and structures of six works: \\"The Purple Jar,\\" Alice in Wonderland, Dr. Doolittle, Henry Huggins, The Snowy Day, and Plain Cityâ€”all written for young people of varying ages in different times and placesâ€”to identify shared characteristics. He points out markers in each work that allow the adult reader to understand it as a children’s story, shedding light on ingrained adult assumptions and revealing the ways in which adult knowledge and experience remain hidden in apparently simple and innocent texts. Nodelman then engages a wide range of views of children's literature from authors, literary critics, cultural theorists, and specialists in education and information sciences. Through this informed dialogue, Nodelman develops a comprehensive theory of children's literature, exploring its commonalities and shared themes. The Hidden Adult is a focused and sophisticated analysis of children’s literature and a major contribution to the theory and criticism of the genre.",

With 4182 responses from children from Key Stages 1 to 4 (aged from 4 to 16 years), the survey is a follow-up to a similar study completed in 1996. This article concentrates on the participants’ responses to questions about fiction reading; key conclusions in this area include the fact that the majority at least ‘sometimes’ read storybooks/fiction and that the continuing significance of the Harry Potter series is reinforced by the survey. This can be seen in the fact that Potter was the favourite storybook/fictional character for all three Key Stage groups, and the series was quoted as being the favourite story/fictional book by all three age groups. In addition, the participants’ preferences for main characters in their fiction showed that their likes were in many cases reflected by their dislikes. That is, where boys generally disliked reading about a certain type of character (e.g. ‘a girl’), on the whole the girls liked reading about the same type of character.",

          "Drawing on a variety of sources, this essay outlines the beginnings of a political economy of the children's literature publishing industry. The rapidly changing set of institutional and socioeconomic and political circumstances known as fast capitalism provides the backdrop for a detailed discussion of the profound impact that the consolidation of the publishing industry by giant international media conglomerates is having on the kinds of books that are commissioned, written, produced, and marketed. Central to the analysis is a consideration of the continuing commodification of children's literature that is apparent in the ever expanding mass-market side of the industry, the explosive increase in the licensing and merchandizing of characters from children's books and popular films, and the proliferation of a variety of series books that have assumed the status of brand names comparable to other commercial commodities. I give particular attention to some of the debates surrounding the publication of multicultural children's literature as they are especially revealing of political and economic factors that impinge on children's literature. The importance of this analysis for literacy educators and researchers derives from the conviction that the complex processes that lead to the publication of literature for young people directly influences the kinds of books that are available to members of society and thus is crucial to the future of both education and democratic society.",

          "Think about the following list of new literacies practices, and evaluate your literacy performance as compared with your students': emailing; blogging; instant messaging; chatting online; maintaining a website; conducting and collating online searches; processing and evaluating online information; participating in online social networking spaces; manipulating and sharing images; podcasting and videocasting; creating and sharing music videos; shopping online; digital storytelling; reading, writing, and commenting on fan fiction and graphic novels; and creating and sharing digital mashups (Gainer & Lapp, 2010). If you're like us, you may agree that it's exciting but difficult to keep pace with all of the new literacies. Since the advent of the Inter- net, change is what has defined instructional classroom literacy practices-not just because of what is being taught, but also because of the literacies students are choosing to learn outside of the classroom.",

          "Given the realities of this increasingly connected, complex, and conflicting age, governments and policymakers around the world are recognizing the importance of global education. The field of literacy has not been immune to the pressure to globalize. Today, the notion of literacy must account not merely for social processes but also for global processes. The global turn in literacy studies affirms the cultural and linguistic diversity of students and acknowledges the need to empower them with a plurality of literacies—critical, digital, information, and multilingual literacies, among others—to prepare them for future workplaces. Among the range of new literacies, the most fundamental is cosmopolitan literacy because it entails critical, aesthetic, and empathetic skills and dispositions needed to engage with diverse values in our globalized world. In this commentary, the author discusses the principles informing cosmopolitan literacy and how it can be developed through literature.",

This chapter explores how critics' reviews are shaped by the perceived consequences of their evaluations. Based on interviews with critics from The New York Times , The LA Times , The Washington Post and others, this chapter reveals the complex emotions and professional ethics that reviewers grapple with when writing negative reviews, including sympathy for the authors, implications for their reputation, fear of retribution, and the temptation of self-promotion.",

On the other hand, there is also evidence to suggest that the new practices of reviewing are only repeating established patterns and behaviours. If this is the case, the private criticism that has been applauded as a democratization of the reading and evaluation of literature does not offer any real change.",

          "As more Anglo trainees choose multicultural counseling as a specialty area, a closer examination of white on white professional activity would appear imperative. Researchers mailed questionnaires to 48 counseling psychology students in a graduate-level program at a Midwestern university. The surveys requested a general description of trainees' reactions to classroom sessions committed to multicultural literature presentations and discussions. Of the 39 students who completed the survey, 26 indicated an overall positive reaction to the presentation and discussion of multicultural issues, while 13 students gave an overall negative reaction. This latter group reveals that a critical mass of practitioners/researchers completed course work and yet rejected the concepts of multiculturalism and diversity. All trainees perceived each other as competent in service delivery, even though some trainees reported that multiculturally reactive (negative) students exhibited disrespect for content, the classroom process, the instructor(s), and peers who voiced different perspectives. Since no penalties exist for disrespectful students, an insensitivity to diversity can remain a constant among trainees in, and graduates of, training programs with multicultural counseling content. Further study of this problem, using larger samples, is recommended. (RJM)",

          "The literary field has been conceptualized in social scientific work as patterned in particular ways. Historically, popular reading has been linked with contested processes of social change. Tastes for reading have, following Bourdieu, been seen as embedded in continuing processes of distinction and the making of hierarchies. Research has demonstrated the ways in which these hierarchies might be reflective of gender as well as of class relationships. This article examines the findings of the Cultural Capital and Social Exclusion study in the light of these debates. The survey gathered data about the types of reading material used by a representative sample of the United Kingdom (UK) population, including their preferences for newspapers, magazines and books. The article reports on a number of possible relationships identified in the study about the location of reading as a social practice, drawing on the survey data and explanatory accounts of respondents' reading preferences...",

This article takes the reader as its central focus to examine not just uses of the internet to comment upon reading after the fact, but also how online reading formations mediate the act of reading itself. The burgeoning phenomenon of online book communities puts readers into relationships in which categories of geographical location, age, appearance, and (to a large extent) socio-economic status are irrelevant, permitting a “purer” form of book talk than traditional embodied settings. Infinite Summer, a 2009 online book club in which members supported each other in reading David Foster Wallace’s (in)famously labyrinthine novel Infinite Jest (1996), documents reading as a formative process, in which readers are facilitated by networked technologies to intervene in the process of other readers’ meaning-making.

The ‘omnivore thesis’ contends that there is a sector of the population of western countries who do and like a greater variety of forms of culture than previously, and that this broad engagement reflects emerging values of tolerance and undermines snobbery. This article draws on the findings of a study of cultural participation in the UK to explore the coherence of the omnivore thesis. It uses a survey to identify and isolate omnivores, and then proceeds to explore the meanings of omnivorousness through the analysis of in-depth, qualitative interviews with them. It concludes that, while there is evidence of wide cultural participation within the UK, the figure of the omnivore is less singularly distinctive than some...",

Nossa investigação parte dos debates teóricos sobre as diferentes nomenclaturas utilizadas para folksonomia e de Sites de Redes Sociais Segmentadas (SRSS) e seus diferentes usos. Com o intuito de observar as aplicações desses conceitos, realizamos uma observação exploratória da interface do site norte-americano Goodreads descrevendo suas potencialidades de etiquetamento social. Os resultados iniciais indicam que a folksonomia no Goodreads pode ser compreendida como processo para organização pessoal das leituras e a catalogação social funciona para a visibilidade e buscabilidade das resenhas.",

The introduction briefly addresses the world of children's literature criticism and puts forward some of the fundamental issues which will be dealt with as the thesis develops. Chapter One looks at some of the arguments put forward by Jacqueline Rose and Karin Lesnik-Oberstein and their reading of the fundamental issues regarding the place of the child in the writing and criticism of children's literature. The chapter draws parallels between their work and that of Jean-Jacques Lecercle as he writes about the notion of alterity. Chapter Two introduces the notion of childist criticism, its origins, uses, and shortcomings. Through childist criticism, the chapter offers an alternative position to that of Rose and Lesnik-Oberstein. Chapter Three considers some of implications deriving from the arguments developed...",

          "\\"For the past seven years, the Stanford Literary Lab, founded by Franco Moretti and Matthew Jockers, has been a leading site of literary scholarship aided by computers and algorithmic methods. This landmark volume gathers the collective research of the group and its most remarkable experiments. From seemingly ineffable matters such as the \\"loudness\\" of thousands of novels, the geographic distribution of emotions, the nature of a sentence and a paragraph, and the evolution of bureaucratic doublespeak, descriptions emerge. The Stanford Literary Lab lets the computers provide new insights for questions from the deep tradition of two centuries of literary inquiry. Rather than, like the rest of us, letting the computers lead. The results are adventurous, witty, challenging, profound. The old questions can finally get new answers–as the prelude to new big questions. Canon/Archive is the fulfillment and further development of \\"distant reading,\\" adding a rare, full-length monument to the piecemeal progress of the digital humanities. No student, teacher, or inquisitive reader of literature will want to be without this book–just as no one interested in the new data-attentive methods in history, criticism, and the social sciences can afford to evade its summons\\"–Back cover.",

Drawing on notions of \`liveness', participation, convergence and interactivity, it argues that Twitter provides a potentially significant development in our understanding of audiences and their relationship with media, both \`old' and \`new'. The study looks at examples of Twitter users engaging with (and in some cases creating) the news and discussing television programmes. The author's own experiences of using Twitter in audience research provide a case study suggesting possible directions for future research using this medium.",

          "In Distinction, Pierre Bourdieu famously proposes the concept of an 'aesthetic disposition': a capacity to conceive the world in terms of form rather than function. Acquired through education, this disposition serves as a key marker of cultural privilege. Building on subsequent critical discussions regarding the applicability of aesthetic disposition (or lack of) beyond Bourdieu's own context, I argue that in the contemporary cultural context, formal appreciation has been supplanted by critical reading as a marker of a privileged and educated orientation towards culture and that this 'critical disposition' is directly relevant to the project of cultural studies. Addressing the importance of critical reading in new venues of cultural criticism, I argue that the elevation of critical over formal orientations towards culture speaks to the success of certain forms of cultural studies, but also threatens to associate critique with privilege in ways that undercut its emancipatory promise....",

          "This article examines the activities of literary reviewers and the conditions under which they perform their task of judging recently published works of fiction. Reviewers and other members of the institution of criticism usually present their assessments as a highly personal matter, in which the intrinsic properties of the texts under consideration are focused on. To understand why this view is incorrect one must consider the choices and statements of reviewers in relation with the social environment in which they come about. Following a theoretical discussion of the institutional nature of critical choices and judgements, an empirical analysis is undertaken of the selection Dutch reviewers made from the supply of new fiction titles in the 1970s and 1990s. The findings show that reviewers tend to be on the safe side when dealing with recently published texts. In addition to the text itself, they take due note of extra-textual indicators of quality, such as the publishing house that marketed the title and, especially, the assessments of other critics. In doing so, they reduce the uncertainty as to which works deserve their attention. Hence, they reduce the risk of making the choices that might jeopardize their status as literary experts.",

          "The aim of this article is to increase the understanding of how cultural consumers—in this era of increasing Internet usage and more omnivorous cultural taste patterns—use and rate different types of cultural mediators in informing themselves on cultural matters. We focus on how book readers in the Netherlands and Flanders consult critics of varying degrees of institutionalization (experts, Internet reviewers and peers). This research contributes to the overarching question of whether systems of value attribution are becoming less hierarchical in Western societies. The findings suggest that Internet-related information-retrieval practices have a limited effect on the perceived legitimacy of critics. Omnivorous taste patterns do lead to less belief in expert critics, but only if they concern patterns within one genre—the specific domain of book reading. Omnivorousness that implies combining several genres and topics is associated with higher ratings of all types of critics. Therefore, having broader informational needs and broader general taste repertoires leads to the inclusion of critics coming from outside the traditional literary institutions, but, at the same time, does not lead to the exclusion of expert critics.",

          "This article examines the meanings and norms surrounding subjectivity across traditional and new forms of cultural journalism. While the ideal of objectivity is key to American journalism and its development as a profession, recent scholarship and new media developments have challenged the dominance of objectivity as a professional norm. This article begins with the understanding that subjectivity is an intractable part of knowing (and reporting on) the world around us to build our understanding of different modes of subjectivity and how these animate journalistic practices. Taking arts reporting, specifically reviewing, as a case study, the analysis draws on interviews with 40 book reviewers who write for major American newspapers, including The New York Times, The Los Angeles Times, The Washington Post, and prominent blogs. Findings reveal how emotions, bias, and self-interest are salient – sometimes as vice and sometimes as virtue – across the workflow of critics writing for...",

          "Purpose The purpose of this paper is to present an analysis of Goodreads’ user-generated book reviews from a linguistic perspective for insights into the psychological aspects of reviewers’ perceptions and behaviors. This examination of users’ language and perspectives may shed light on the role and value of user-generated reviews in complementing the traditional representation of resources and facilitating the discoverability of cultural objects. Design/methodology/approach This study involved a textual analysis of 474,803 unique reviews of Goodreads’ 2015 top-rated books generated by 9,335 Goodreads’ reviewers. In order to better understand the nuances of user-generated reviews, a content analysis was applied to 2,500 reviews of each of the five top-ranked titles in Goodreads’ Fiction Literature genre category. Findings The analysis of user-generated reviews demonstrates that language is a quite stable and reliable dimension across Goodreads’ users. The high rate of function words utilized, in particular I-words, coupled with positive emotion words, suggests that reviewers tended to convey their opinions in order to influence other individuals’ reading choices, or in Bourdieu’s (1985) terms, influence cultural production. In line with previous studies of user-generated reviews, the prevalence of positive reviews may also imply their unreliable nature. This study supports the importance of transparency regarding inclusion of user-generated reviews in traditional systems of knowledge representation, organization and discovery, such as WorldCat. Originality/value This study contributes to better understanding of linguistic characteristics of Goodreads’ reviews, including the role and value of user-generated reviews in complementing traditional representation of resources and facilitating discoverability of cultural objects.",

          "prior research has demonstrated only downsides to negative press. Negative reviews or word of mouth, for example, have been found to hurt product evaluation and sales. Using a combination of econometric analysis and experimental methods, we unify these perspectives to delineate contexts under which negative publicity about a product will have positive versus negative effects. Specifically, we argue that negative publicity can increase purchase likelihood and sales by increasing product awareness. Consequently, negative publicity should have differential effects on established versus unknown products. Three studies support this perspective. Whereas a negative review in the New York Times hurt sales of books by well-known authors, for example, it increased sales of books that had lower prior awareness. The studies further underscore the importance of a gap between publicity and purchase occasion and the mediating role of increased awareness in these effects.",

          "As blogs have become a fixture in today’s media environment, growing in number and influence in political communication and (mass) media discourse, research on the subject has proliferated, often emphasizing the high-profile conflicts and controversies at the intersection of blogging and journalism. Less examined, however, is the psychology of everyday citizen bloggers in this context. In studying a randomized sample of US bloggers, we attempt to puzzle out these questions: to what extent do bloggers (1) perceive their work as a form of journalism, and how might such a perception influence (2) their motivations for posting and (3) the topics around which they blog? Most critically, (4) this article constructs a model by which all these antecedents predict whether bloggers behave like professional journalists. Results indicate that bloggers who see their work as a form of journalism are more inclined to inform and influence readers, write about public affairs, and behave as...",

          "This paper employs Hannah Arendt’s characterization of the social , which lacks location and mandates conformity, to evaluate social media’s: a) challenge to the polis , b) relationship to the social, b) influence on private space, d) impact on public space, and e) virus-like capacity to capture, mimic, and replicate the agonistic polis, where “everything [is] decided through words and persuasion and not through force and violence.” Using Arendt’s exact language, this paper begins by discussing how she differentiated the political, private, social, and public realms. After explaining how online activities resemble (or not) her notion of the social, I demonstrate how the rise of the social, which she characterized as dominated by behavior (not action), ruled by nobody and occurring nowhere, continues to eclipse both private and public space at an alarming pace. Finally, I discuss the ramifications of social media’s setting the stage for worldlessness to spin out of control, as the public square becomes an intangible web. Unlike an Arendtian web of worldly human relationships that fosters individuality and enables excellence to be publicly tested, social media feeds a craving for kinship and connection, however remotely. Leaving such needs unfulfilled, social media risks to trump bios politicos.",

One major controversy for the new medium of circulating news and commentary is to what extent or even whether blogs should have codes of ethics. We examined 30 politically-oriented weblogs. Of these, only a few had a code of ethics, stated or implied. Little cohesion existed between the codes of ethics, but a few themes emerged. Qualitative analysis of the codes of ethics shows that what bloggers valued most included accuracy, credibility, and etiquette.

          "This essay describes a fan-based pedagogy and the learning outcomes it produced among college students. We focus on a fandom assignment given in an ‘Introduction to American Popular Culture’ course in an American Studies department at a large state university. The assignment required students to conduct a study of a fan community of their choice. Students developed and administered questionnaires, conducted interviews, and wrote essays describing and interpreting their findings. They were required to include a reflective paragraph discussing what they learned about fandom as a result of their research. Using content analysis, we coded 135 essays from four sections of the class to identify how students spoke about what they learned. Students reported acquiring a deeper understanding of the role of fandom in constructing identity and community. In addition, many questioned and changed their preconceptions about fans and fan behavior. A number also noted that they acquired an appreciation for the theories and methods of academic fan studies. A majority of students indicated that studying fandom resulted in greater self- awareness and awareness of others. We make the case that learning and applying the methods of fan studies prepares students to engage the world outside the classroom with a more critical and reflective lens.",

Insights are drawn from the research and commentaries of specialists, including scholars of literature and bibliometricians. Peer review, as it is seen in book reviews, plays a critical role in how literary quality is perceived, while citations, from books and journal articles may be used to trace patterns of influence. To evaluate literary work as a whole, we suggest distinguishing between different types of production, vocational and epistemic , and orchestrating data systems that allow for combined measures of quality, scholarly influence, and cultural influence.",

          "Although peer-review and citation counts are commonly used to help assess the scholarly impact of published research, informal reader feedback might also be exploited to help assess the wider impacts of books, such as their educational or cultural value. The social website Goodreads seems to be a reasonable source for this purpose because it includes a large number of book reviews and ratings by many users inside and outside of academia. To check this, Goodreads book metrics were compared with different book-based impact indicators for 15,928 academic books across broad fields. Goodreads engagements were numerous enough in the arts (85% of books had at least one), humanities (80%), and social sciences (67%) for use as a source of impact evidence. Low and moderate correlations between Goodreads book metrics and scholarly or non-scholarly indicators suggest that reader feedback in Goodreads reflects the many purposes of books rather than a single type of impact. Although Goodreads book metrics...",

Insights are drawn from the research and commentaries of specialists, including scholars of literature and bibliometricians. Peer review, as it is seen in book reviews, plays a critical role in how literary quality is perceived, while citations, from books and journal articles may be used to trace patterns of influence. To evaluate literary work as a whole, we suggest distinguishing between different types of production, vocational and epistemic , and orchestrating data systems that allow for combined measures of quality, scholarly influence, and cultural influence.",

          "Reading and writing book reviews for learned journals plays an important part in academic life but little is known about how academics carry out these tasks. The aim of this research was to explore these activities with academics from the arts and humanities, the social sciences, and the natural sciences. An electronic questionnaire was used to ascertain (a) how often the respondents read and wrote book reviews, (b) how useful they found them, and (c) what features they thought important in book reviews. Fifty‐two academics in the arts, 53 in the social sciences, and 51 in the sciences replied. There were few disciplinary differences. Most respondents reported reading between one and five book reviews a month and writing between one and two a year. There was high overall agreement between what the respondents thought were important features of book reviews, but there were also wide individual differences between them. This agreement across the disciplines supports the notion that book reviews can be seen as an academic genre with measurable features. This has implications for how they are written, and how authors might be taught to write them better. A potential checklist for authors is suggested.",

          "Previous studies on informational cascades have stressed the importance of informational social influences in decision-making. When people use the product evaluations of others to indicate product quality on the Internet, online herd behavior occurs. This work presents four studies examining herd behavior of online book purchasing. The first two studies addressed how two cues frequently found on the Internet, i.e., star ratings and sales volume, influence consumer online product choices. The last two studies investigated the relative effectiveness of different recommendation sources. The experimental results demonstrated that subjects use the product evaluations and choices of others as cues in making purchasing book decisions on the Internet bookstore. Additionally, recommendations of other consumers exerted a greater influence on subject choices than recommendations of an expert. Finally, recommendations from recommender system influenced online consumer choices more than those...",

          "This article offers an analysis of the impact of professional social-media engagement upon authors. Authors primarily use Facebook, Twitter and there is growing use of Pinterest. Authors use social-media platforms primarily for marketing, publicity and making contact with readers. They tend to adopt a multi-layered approach to self-presentation and the lines between their ‘public’ and ‘private’ identities are blurred. The research reveals a limited author-reader community, but a much stronger online author–author community, founded upon practical support and encouragement. There are implications for the publishing industry as authors believe their publishers lack social-media expertise. The commercial benefits of maintaining a social-media presence are unclear for many authors.",

          "Purpose - This paper aims to present an exploratory investigation that was used to understand consumer motives for reading internet book reviews as well as the effects of these reviews on purchasing behavior.Design methodology approach - First, focus group interviews of 45 subjects who regularly read internet book reviews and have purchased online books were conducted. Then, content analysis was used to document the rich and diverse experiences and viewpoints of the interview participants.Findings - This exploratory study uncovered five main motives behind the reading of internet book reviews by consumers and illustrated the effects of these reviews and opinions on consumers' purchasing and communication behavior.Practical implications - The results of this study can help online booksellers to understand the role played by consumers' motives for reading internet book reviews in the book-purchasing process, and the resulting influences on purchases. At the same time, the results can serve as a reference in establishing book review management and marketing strategies.Originality value - Searching online word-of-mouth reviews has become an important link in consumers' purchasing decision making. The present study investigates consumer thoughts on motives for reading internet book reviews and their effects, and puts forward several management suggestions.",

          "Purpose The purpose of this paper is to contribute to research on information sharing by drawing on the reader-response theory developed by Louise Rosenblatt. To this end, information sharing is approached by examining how bloggers communicate their reading experiences of fiction and non-fiction books. Design/methodology/approach The conceptual framework is based on the differentiation between efferent and aesthetic reading stances specified by Rosenblatt. The efferent stance directs attention to what is to be extracted from reading for instrumental purposes such as task performance. The aesthetic stance focuses on what is being lived through during the reading event. Rosenblatt’s framework was elaborated by specifying eight categories of efferent reading and six categories of aesthetic reading. The ways in which bloggers communicate their responses to such readings were examined by scrutinising a sample of 300 posts from two book blogs. Findings The bloggers mainly articulated responses to efferent reading by sharing information about the content of the reviewed books, as well as their strengths and weaknesses. Responses to aesthetic reading were mainly articulated by describing how the bloggers experienced the narrative, what kind immersive experiences they had and what kind of emotions were felt during the reading process. Research limitations/implications As the study is explorative in nature and focusses on a sample of blog posts, the findings cannot be generalised to depict how people share their responses to efferent and aesthetic reading in social media forums. Originality/value The paper pioneers by examining the potential of Rosenblatt’s theory in the study of sharing information about reading experiences in book blogs. The findings demonstrate that the categories of efferent and aesthetic reading can be elaborated further for the needs of information behaviour research.",

          "This paper uses the findings from a new study of cultural tastes and participation in the UK to explore the characteristics of the cultural omnivore. It identifies some uncertainty in the existing literature about the precise elements of an omnivorous orientation in relation to (i) the relative importance of volume and composition of omnivorous tastes, (ii) the reliance on the secondary analysis of survey data for the identification and exposition of omnivorousness and (iii) the relationship between tolerance for a range of cultural items and other forms of tolerance. Taking as a starting point the claim that cultural omnivores are relatively open to diversity, and drawing on both survey data and qualitative interviews with omnivores, the paper analyses the characteristics of an omnivorous portfolio and considers in detail what and how omnivores dislike. It concludes that, whilst there is strong evidence of a decline in overt snobbishness in the UK, there is also evidence...",

          "Book reviews written by readers and published on digital sites such as Goodreads are a new force in contemporary book culture. This article uses feminist standpoint theory to investigate the language used in Goodreads reviews to better understand how these reviewers articulate intimate reading experiences. A total of 692 reviews of seven bestselling fiction and nonfiction books are analyzed by two methods. The first, thematic content analysis, involves close reading of the reviews. The second, sentiment analysis, is an automated “distant reading” process. These methods prompt us, as researchers, to reflect on the way they foster or inhibit a sense of proximity to readers, even as they reveal predominant features of Goodreads reviews. Together, the methods reveal that 86.1% of Goodreads reviews describe a reading experience, and 68% specifically mention an emotional reaction to the book, with the emotion most intense in reviews of fiction. Reviews also create social connections...",

While the individuals featured in this article participate in shared affinity spaces around a passion for reading and writing books, they also participate in a publishing industry increasingly reliant on reviews and ratings. I argue that the sabotaging and bullying of authors and reviewers, and the power dynamics reinforced through these tactics, risk being occluded by scholarship that emphasizes the literacy practices fostered through participatory culture over the content and social actions reproduced through them. My analysis of book reviewing practices demonstrates the need to critique the positive imagery evoked by terms like ‘participatory’, ‘affinity’, ‘online community’, ‘shared goals’, and ‘collective knowledge’ and to examine these terms within their specific discursive...",

          "What is a book review? Many have attempted to answer this question over the last few decades in a multitude of ways—from informed scholars, librarians, and booksellers to publishers, authors and readers. While their views differ widely on how successful book reviews are in bringing us closer to a book’s quality—and whether this is even possible—their definitions of book reviews and their core purpose seem to be in sync. To start, book reviews are a ‘genre’ in their own right, as they have features specific to them, and they can be as entertaining to read as the books they put under the microscope. These features, of course, depend on the context in which the books are reviewed (e.g., reviews found in academic journals are more in-depth and lengthier than those found in mainstream newspapers and magazines), but the general purpose of book reviews is always to serve as kind of an economic model, helping readers—whoever they may be—to decide if they should spend their money on a book, be it for entertainment, enlightenment, or scholarly pursuit. In other words, the main purpose of book reviews is to reduce search costs and uncertainty (Clement &amp; others 78). In this sense, then, readers hope that book reviews will guide them in the direction of the books they both want and need.",

By examining the MemeEconomy community on Reddit, where 'meme traders' appropriate stock market terminology to discuss and appraise memes, this article aims to understand how this particular subculture of self-proclaimed meme insiders assigns value to viral media. Our findings point to the salience of four key features that are seen to determine a meme's value: its positioning in relation to the mainstream, its versatility and expansion potential, its topicality or cultural relevance, and its perceived quality. We discuss implications for the formation and reinforcement of subcultural identities around memes, and theorize the role of vernacular criticism as fulfilling significant social functions in online communities....",

Racial Ecologies explores activist strategies and creative responses, such as those of Mexican migrant women, New Zealand Maori, and African American farmers in urban Detroit, demonstrating that people of color have always been and continue to be leaders in the fight for a more equitable and ecologically just world. Grounded in an ethnic-studies perspective, this interdisciplinary collection illustrates how race intersects with Indigeneity, colonialism, gender, nationality, and class to shape our understanding of both nature and environmental harm, showing how and why environmental issues are also racial issues. Indeed, Indigenous, critical race, and postcolonial frameworks are crucial for comprehending and addressing accelerating anthropogenic change, from the local to the global, and for imagining speculative futures. This forward-looking, critical intervention bridges environmental scholarship and ethnic studies and will prove indispensable to activists, scholars, and students alike.",

          "In this article we study how the frequency of book-reading – a form of legitimate culture – develops in the period from adolescence to young adulthood and how it is influenced by parents’ education, parental reading socialization climate, school and their interactions. In disentangling parental and educational effects we contribute to the cultural reproduction–cultural mobility debate. We use multi-actor panel data on three cohorts of Dutch secondary school students (and their parents) who took part in a classroom survey between the ages of 14 and 17, and who participated in at least one of the follow-up surveys two, four and six years later. We find that the amount of book-reading is more strongly associated with education than with parents’ reading socialization. The influence of parents increases slightly in the period from adolescence to young adulthood. Differences in reading behaviour between students of different educational programmes increase during secondary education,...",

Literature opens worlds, he provocatively suggests, because it is a force of receptivity. Cheah compellingly argues for postcolonial literature s exemplarity as world literature through readings of narrative fiction by Michelle Cliff, Amitav Ghosh, Nuruddin Farah, Ninotchka Rosca, and Timothy Mo that show how these texts open up new possibilities for remaking the world by negotiating with the inhuman force that gives time and deploying alternative temporalities to resist capitalist globalization.\\" – Provided by publisher",

          "Social media has increasingly become a strong factor that shapes how we communicate about social and political ideas. And it has been argued that Twitter and other social media platforms empower voices that were previously marginalized, hold governments accountable and provides opportunities for individuals to network and campaign to achieve social and political reforms. In this collection of chapters, authors from different academic disciplines, coming from different social and political backgrounds and experiences have explored the increasing transformative potentials of Twitter for group advocacy. The chapters further illustrate how Twitter serves as a forum for spreading awareness and information on social events, as well as for social activism and political discourse. Some of the topics explored include: Understanding the potential of Twitter for political activism; Digital Trump and conflict: A multi-method analysis; The use of Twitter as complementary press on the disappearance of the Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370; Constructing transnational identity through Twitter activism: A discourse study of #FGM; LGBT social media activism in India; Online activism in Mali: a study of digital discourses of the Movement for the Liberation of Azawad; Sousveilance Twitter: activists’ pro-democracy governance from below in Middle East; Twitter’s ethics of freedom in the aftermath of November 2015 Paris attacks through the lens of the anonymous collective, etc. This collection of chapters written by experts, and budding academics from different disciplines, will be an invaluable handbook and serves as resource materials for students, scholars and practitioners of Communication, Political Science and International Relations, Law, Linguistics, Journalism and Media Studies.",

          "Far from being neutral, social media platforms - such as Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, and WeChat - possess their own material characteristics, which shape how people engage, protest, resist, and struggle. This innovative collection advances the notion of social media materialities to draw attention to the ways in which the wires and silicon, data streams and algorithms, user and programming interfaces, business models and terms of service steer contentious practices and, inversely, how technologies and economic models are handled and performed by users. The key question is how the tension between social media's techno-commercial infrastructures and activist agency plays out in protest. Addressing this, the volume goes beyond singular empirical examples and focuses on the characteristics of protest and social media materialities, offering further conceptualizations and guidance for this emerging field of research. The various contributions explore a wide variety of activist projects, protests, and regions, ranging from Occupy in the USA to environmental protests in China, and from the Mexican Barrio Nómada to the Copenhagen-based activist television channel TV Stop (1987-2005).",

Taking the charge to look back over fifty years of Marxist theory of the novel, this polemic argues that critique cannot come to a close because it has not yet properly begun. The fundamentally dialectical project of critique–what Marx called the \\"ruthless criticism of everything existing\\" and what he practiced as its correlative utopian striving for what does not exist–has not yet taken foot in literary method. To explore what that project might look like, I outline a theory of the critique immanent to the literary form of the novel itself, and I conclude with a brief reading of a recent novel as critique, Colson Whitehead's The Underground Railroad.",

Although Kierkegaard's and Sartre's respective views on reading and writing do not receive much attention today, I argue that both articulate (albeit in different ways) a notion of shared responsibility between reader and writer that is compatible with their respective emphases on absolute responsibility for oneself, for others, and for the situation. An advantage to both Sartre's and Kierkegaard's accounts from a postmodern perspective, is that they affirm the simultaneity of individual and co-responsibility without appealing to a fixed or unitary self.",

          "Many studies have examined the business of children's literature from an academic perspective. While the academic literature provides one view of the business aspects surrounding the production of children's books, it often fails to include the perspective of the individuals working in the industry, and espouses the view that people working within the corporate structure are unable to assert their individual agency as it relates to the publishing process. This qualitative study addresses the notion that when situated within an academic Discourse (Gee 1996), the individual voices of those working in the business of children's publishing are silenced. Gee's (1996) notion of Discourse as a way in which we identify ourselves with distinct groups through “particular social roles that others will recognize” (p. 128), and how Discourses establish perspective and social position is foundational in this work. With his ideas in mind, 32 interviews were conducted over a one-year period with authors, illustrators, editors, publishers, and agents currently working in the field of children's publishing to establish their interpretations of the business Discourse surrounding children's publishing. Interviews were transcribed and analyzed using a within-case approach that eventually gave way to cross case analysis, which yielded themes regarding individual roles within the publishing process; balancing financial responsibility with literary quality; balancing the multiple audiences for children's books; and personal connections to the creative process. When the themes were investigated and compared to one another, individual agency became an overarching theme. Aiming to offer a unique look inside the business of children's publishing, this dissertation offers findings replete with the personal experiences, insights, beliefs, values, and ideas of people functioning within the business Discourse; the data allow the participants to clarify how their individual agency plays a role in the business of children's publishing. This project challenges and extends the current research and writing regarding the business of children's publishing from an academic perspective that excludes the business Discourse. In concurrence with Taxel (2002), this project demonstrates a joining of the two usually separate Discourses will offer a more complete picture of business of children's publishing.",

          "The treatment in what follows of the politics of hegemony is not per se one of Gramsci, or Laclau or of Stuart Hall's earlier work. At stake is something that encompasses a more general regime of power that will be developed throughout the length of this: what might be called 'extensive politics'. What I will try to show is that such extensive power or such an extensive politics is being progressively displaced by a politics of intensity. I will trace the shift from hegemony or extensive politics to such an intensive politics in terms of: 1) a transition to an ontological regime of power, from a regime that in important respects is 'epistemological', 2) a shift in power from the hegemonic mode of 'power over' to an intensive notion of power from within (including domination from within) and power as generative force, 3) a shift from power and politics in terms of normativity to a regime of power much more based in what can be understood as a 'facticity'....",

          "This essay explores the notion of meaning, particularly as applied to acts of producing and reading texts. The analysis is grounded in principles of activity theory and cultural semiotics and focuses on the ways in which reading takes place among readers and texts in a culturally mediated, codified experience characterized here as the ?transactional zone.? The author builds on Vygotsky?s work to argue that meaning comes through a reader?s generation of new texts in response to the text being read. As a means of accounting for this phenomenon, examples are provided from studies illustrating, for instance, Vygotsky?s zones of meaning, the dialogic role of composing during a reading transaction, and the necessity of culturally constructed subjectivity in meaning construction. The author concludes by locating meaning in the transactional zone in which signs become tools for extending or developing concepts and the richness of meaning coming from the potential of a reading transaction to generate new texts.?When I use a word,? Humpty Dumpty said in a rather scornful tone, ?it means just what I choose it to mean?neither more nor less.? (Lewis Carroll, Through the Looking Glass)",

Teacher education literature dealing with white privilege and its effects on pre- and in-service teachers are examined for common themes and ways teacher educators work to expose and mitigate the effects of white privilege. The study also offers educators who work with children's literature a way of assessing white privilege issues in those texts, through the use of Janet Helms' White Racial Identity Development theory. The culminating aspect of the study is an in-depth analysis of a popular children's novel, Maniac Magee. Application of the Helms' approach to this novel delineates how the main character progresses though stages of development as he contacts characters who come from backgrounds both similar to and different from his own.",

          "Fan studies has been critical and groundbreaking in a number of respects. However, in regard to methodology, discussion seems decidedly thin on the ground. Such a missing discourse has wider implications, raising questions such as: what kinds of knowledge do fan studies researchers want to produce? What are the objects being studied? How does fan studies inform a general approach to research? And how is the area going to maintain itself, if we don’t start talking about our methodology and world - view? This paper is an attempt to bring the discussion of methodology to the fore in fan studies. In doing so, we show how the history of methodology in media and cultural studies implies certain methods. We then turn to newer methodologies in interpretative qualitative research. From here, we argue that there is room for mutual dialogue between fan studies and methodology: namely in work around the ‘aca-fan’ subject position of the researcher; and in digital research opened up by online modes of fandom and fan activism.",

          "In this paper we look at what the critical tradition in education has to offer to the phenomenon of social media. Through an overview and evaluation of the approaches advocated by practitioners of critical literacy and critical media literacy, we illustrate the limitations of applying these frameworks to the fluid and densely interwoven spaces of social media. In particular we focus on the problematic nature of textual analysis and textual production as foundations for a critique of new media. By proposing a conceptual model that maps the inter-relationship between practice, identity and networks, we make a new contribution to the field, suggesting that this approach may provide a more fruitful analytical tool for educators. Drawing on the work of Greenhow and Robelia (2009), and particularly their notion of advantageous practice, we work towards a model for enabling children and young people to move from a consideration of what they do through social media to a view of what they might do. We suggest that this may be a more fruitful way of approaching social media, but one which remains faithful to the overall project of the critical tradition.",

This study explored those framing values and documented individual role play within this Midwestern city’s information-producing community. An informal interpretive community of citizen journalists offers ways of knowing distinct from the way the press has traditionally practiced, negotiated and shared news stories. Interviews with citizens and professional journalists revealed convergences between these groups of news writers as well as dichotomies. This evidence showed that both the entrenched community of journalists and the emerging one of citizen news writers are framed by values of socially responsible missions, access to information, entitlement to knowledge and informal notions of professionalism. When ‘anyone can know’ – a quote from these interviews – the result is an adaptive organization of information...",

          "\\"The zany, the cute, and the interesting saturate postmodern culture. They dominate the look of its art and commodities as well as our discourse about the ambivalent feelings these objects often inspire. In this radiant study, Sianne Ngai offers a theory of the aesthetic categories that most people use to process the hypercommodified, mass-mediated, performance-driven world of late capitalism, treating them with the same seriousness philosophers have reserved for analysis of the beautiful and the sublime. Ngai explores how each of these aesthetic categories expresses conflicting feelings that connect to the ways in which postmodern subjects work, exchange, and consume. As a style of performing that takes the form of affective labor, the zany is bound up with production and engages our playfulness and our sense of desperation. The interesting is tied to the circulation of discourse and inspires interest but also boredom. The cute's involvement with consumption brings out feelings of tenderness and aggression simultaneously. At the deepest level, Ngai argues, these equivocal categories are about our complex relationship to performing, information, and commodities. Through readings of Adorno, Schlegel, and Nietzsche alongside cultural artifacts ranging from Bob Perelman's poetry to Ed Ruscha's photography books to the situation comedy of Lucille Ball, Ngai shows how these everyday aesthetic categories also provide traction to classic problems in aesthetic theory. The zany, cute, and interesting are not postmodernity's only meaningful aesthetic categories, Ngai argues, but the ones best suited for grasping the radical transformation of aesthetic experience and discourse under its conditions.\\"–Jacket",

Such a premise is antithetical to the values of academic freedom and the marketplace of ideas and is inconsistent with students’ learning and confronting ideas with which they are unfamiliar and which are outside of their comfort zone. Yielding to demands for trigger warnings when exposing students to ideas, topics and exchanges that may become uncomfortable negates growth for students. In short, acquiescing to the self-serving demands for trigger warnings makes education nothing but the reaffirming of ideas and positions with which students enter the academy.

          "Under Representation shows how the founding texts of aesthetic philosophy ground the racial order of the modern world in our concepts of universality, freedom, and humanity. In taking on the relation of aesthetics to race, Lloyd challenges the absence of sustained thought about race in postcolonial studies, as well as the lack of sustained attention to aesthetics in critical race theory. Late Enlightenment discourse on aesthetic experience proposes a decisive account of the conditions of possibility for universal human subjecthood. The aesthetic forges a powerful “racial regime of representation” whose genealogy runs from enlightenment thinkers like Kant and Schiller to late modernist critics like Adorno and Benjamin. For aesthetic philosophy, representation is not just about depiction of diverse humans or inclusion in political or cultural institutions. It is an activity that undergirds the various spheres of human practice and theory, from the most fundamental acts of perception and reflection to the relation of the subject to the political, the economic, and the social. Representation regulates the distribution of racial identifications along a developmental trajectory: The racialized remain “under representation,” on the threshold of humanity and not yet capable of freedom and civility as aesthetic thought defines those attributes. To ignore the aesthetic is thus to overlook its continuing force in the formation of the racial and political structures down to the present. Across five chapters, Under Representation investigates the aesthetic foundations of modern political subjectivity; race and the sublime; the logic of assimilation and the stereotype; the subaltern critique of representation; and the place of magic and the primitive in modernist concepts of art, aura and representation. Both a genealogy and an account of our present, Under Representation ultimately helps show how a political reading of aesthetics can help us build a racial politics adequate for the problems we face today, one that stakes claims more radical than multicultural demands for representation.",

          "The rise of social networking sites and initiatives such as the One Book, One Twitter book club (#1b1t) make it much easier for readers to share reading experiences on a scale and in a fashion that would not previously have been possible. This paper examines people’s changing reading practices in the age of online social networking. In particular, it aims to describe and explain online conversations around a book called American Gods, the first book of the Twitter book club. Using the automated text analysis and social network discovery software called Netlytic, this study pinpoints a particular time in history that opens new conclusions about the spread of knowledge, education, culture, and ideology. An analysis of the more than 14,000 “tweets” about American Gods provides insight into this world-wide reading group phenomenon, which is now in its second year.",

          "This wide-ranging book argues that criticism emerged in early bourgeois society as a central feature of a “public sphere” in which political, ethical, and literary judgements could mingle under the benign rule of reason. The disintegration of this fragile culture brought on a crisis in criticism, whose history since the 18th century has been fraught with ambivalence and anxiety. Eagleton’s account embraces Addison and Steele, Johnson and the 19-century reviewers, such critics as Arnold and Stephen, the heyday of Scrutiny and New Criticism, and finally the proliferation of avant-garde literary theories such as deconstructionism. The Function of Criticism is nothing less than a history and critique of the “critical institution” itself. Eagleton’s judgements on individual critics are sharp and illuminating, which his general argument raises crucial questions about the relations between language, literature and politics.",

          "Book reviews are one of the tools that librarians use for readers' advisory. Reviews describe the contents of books and place the works into larger literary contexts through comparisons to other works and other authors. Being able to find similar authors and books is a fundamental yet challenging aspect of readers' advisory, and literary comparisons in book reviews play an important part in this process. This paper is a content analysis from a readers' advisory perspective of the number and type of literary comparisons in library and book trade periodicals. A total of 400 fiction book reviews were gathered for the study from Booklist, Library Journal, Kirkus Reviews, and Publishers Weekly. Library Journal and Booklist were found to include the highest percentage of non-neutral comparisons to other works and other authors. It is the recommendation of the study that all of the periodicals should include more non-neutral literary comparisons. This study is valuable to librarians, who consult and write reviews, and to vendors of electronic readers' advisory databases that include full-text book reviews.",

          "Debbie Reese, a former elementary school teacher and assistant professor in American Indian Studies, publishes the blog American Indians in Children's Literature. Tribally enrolled at Nambe Pueblo, her book chapters and articles are taught in university classrooms in English, education, and library science across the U.S. and Canada. She is frequently invited to deliver keynote lectures and workshops at major universities and for tribal associations and organizations. In this article she presents a discussion of an unprecedented happening in children's and young adult literature, which she describes as worlds colliding. Within the space of a year, three different publishers recalled books that were criticized on social media. Within that same period, second printings of several other books were revised, and two children's literature review journals took action to address the way they write reviews. Additionally, writers and editors for several journals, as well as bloggers at those journals' online sites, wrote about issues specific to diversity. Native people and people of color are using social media and content-area blogs to review books that misrepresent them. Reese describes this as not only a collision of media, but also a collision of the point of view and critical lens that Native people and people of color bring to analyses of children's and young adult literature. Reese argues that as the racial and cultural demographics of the United States change, the content of books will change too, and Native children and children of color deserve the mirrors that white children have had for literally hundreds of years. This article provides a glimpse of significant developments that demonstrates how social media is being used to create new understandings among writers, editors, reviewers, teachers, professors, librarians, and parents.",

          "The call for increased diversity in books for adolescent readers should play a role in decisions about purchasing books for library and classroom shelves, and book reviews are an instrumental tool in making these decisions. The research project described here sought to conduct a close examination of book reviews in order to assess whether or not elements of diversity are described in reviews, how they are described, and the degree to which reviews accurately and comprehensively reflect and communicate issues of diversity in the books being reviewed. Through an examination of reviews written about books popular with teens, this research reveals important trends in the portrayals of diversity in these books. It also reveals the complexities of identifying diversity, of describing representations of diversity in short texts like book reviews, and the disconnect that exists at times between reviews and the content of books (in terms of diversity). The article closes with recommendations for librarians and those who review books in response to the call for more diversity in books written for teen readers. The need for diversity in the representations of characters and experiences in books for adolescents has long been recognized by librarians, teachers, and writers of adolescent literature. The most recent push for diversity, collected under the banner of the “We Need Diverse Books” movement (http://weneeddiversebooks.org/), has brought these concerns to the twenty-first",

          "If you're looking for a case study in toxic internet culture, look no further than the online world of young adult fiction. Here's the short version: In recent years, young adult, or Y.A., fiction has come into its own as a genre, reliably producing a small number of megahits that have turned their authors into millionaires. During that same period, it has begun to grapple with some difficult questions about diversity and representation. Y.A. fiction, like many other areas of publishing, has a bit of a diversity problem, despite being a liberal-minded industry located in New York City. But while the motivation behind the movement for more diverse voices is commendable, the manifestation of this impulse on social media has been nothing short of cannibalistic. Y.A. Twitter does not appear to be a representative sample of Y.A. readers. Those readers are split about 50-50 between minors and adults, according to what data they have, but on Twitter the community is almost entirely adults.",

Using in-depth interviews and focus groups combined with textual analysis in a case study of one Midwestern city, we explore the ethical tensions between the commitment to neutrality and the need for trust building in communities. This essay suggests that the current practices by White reporters may be unethical and argues for an active objectivity focused on loyalty to all citizens. This statement about the clashing of ethics explores a middle ground for reporters in historically White-dominated communities caught between long-time norms and the demands of an increasingly diverse society.",

          "Racism Abstract: Early childhood classrooms in the US continue to become increasingly diverse as we journey through the twenty first century. Yet and still, many early childhood educators have been slow to respond to these shifts in diversity on the basis of both developmental and political concerns. In this guess editorial, I argue for the integration of anti-racist education in the early childhood social studies classroom. The reasons I discuss here concern: when and how children develop racial attitudes, the difficulty of altering long-standing stereotypes, student empowerment, critical teacher reflection, and issues of standardization. I conclude with several considerations teachers should heed as they engage in this form of education.

          "In this study, I investigated a new system to classify authors by literary prestige. The notion of ‘canon’ was considered to lack clear theoretical and empirical grounding. Evaluation and classification practices were examined and operationalized from the perspective of literary field theory. The value that is attributed to authors by literary institutions and their agents was taken as the main indicator of literary prestige. Value attribution was measured by establishing the attention authors receive from such institutions as literary encyclopedias, literary prizes, academic studies, and publishing houses. Measurements were conducted for 502 authors varying in both critical acclaim and public appeal. The statistical technique Princals was used to analyze institutions’ measures. The results show that one dimension stood out, which was interpreted as authors’ literary prestige. Given its institutional base, this form of prestige is called Institutional Literary Prestige (ILP)....",

          "The increasing use of social media around global news events, such as the London Olympics in 2012, raises questions for international broadcasters about how to engage with users via social media in order to best achieve their individual missions. Twitter is a highly diverse social network whose conversations are multi-directional involving individual users, political and cultural actors, athletes and a range of media professionals. In so doing, users form networks of influence via their interactions affecting the ways that information is shared about specific global events.This article attempts to understand how networks of influence are formed among Twitter users, and the relative influence of global news media organisations and information providers in the Twittersphere during such global news events. We build an analysis around a set of tweets collected during the 2012 London Olympics. To understand how different users influence the conversations across Twitter, we compare three types of accounts: those belonging to a number of well-known athletes, those belonging to some well-known commentators employed by the BBC, and a number of corporate accounts belonging to the BBC World Service and the official London Twitter account. We look at the data from two perspectives. First, to understand the structure of the social groupings formed among Twitter users, we use a network analysis to model social groupings in the Twittersphere across time and space. Second, to assess the influence of individual tweets, we investigate the ageing factor of tweets, which measures how long users continue to interact with a particular tweet after it is originally posted.We consider what the profile of particular tweets from corporate and athletes’ accounts can tell us about how networks of influence are forged and maintained. We use these analyses to answer the questions: How do different types of accounts help shape the social networks? and, What determines the level and type of influence of a particular account?",

The author reveals entirely fresh ways of considering the values and beliefs of three very different materialists—Marx, Nietzsche, and Wittgenstein—drawing striking comparisons between their philosophies while reflecting on a wide array of topics, from ideology and history to language, ethics, and the aesthetic. Cogently demonstrating how it is our bodies and corporeal activity that make thought and consciousness possible, Eagleton’s book is a valuable exposition on philosophic thought that strikes to the heart of how we think about ourselves and live in the world.",

These changes occurred after a series of author/reviewer incidents in 2012 and 2013. This article presents a case study of one of those incidents in 2012, when a Goodreads reviewer wrote a negative review of a novel, the author and agent responded on Twitter, and a public discussion ensued around behavior standards for both literary professionals and nonprofessionals. The above incident, and how it does or does not foreshadow the later changes in Goodreads policy, offers a lens through which to examine evolving reading and writing practices and literary censorship, as well as how nonprofessional book reviewers and readers conceive of their and literary professionals’ roles in a complex social media literary landscape.",

          "Using Frank Kermode's (1967. The sense of an ending: studies in the theory of fiction with a new epilogue. Oxford: OUP) formulation of 'the End' as its conceptual marker, this paper takes aim at pronouncements of cultural studies' demise. In recent years, it has become fashionable to declare cultural studies as in decline, if not irretrievably lost. In drawing on this conceptualization of 'the End' to define the current status of cultural studies, attention will be given to how narratives of demise and decline claim a position of speaking-for the discipline whilst reifying selective moments of cultural studies' past as markers of a 'high point', a halcyon moment from which the current malaise is contrasted. Arguing that this is a troubling dynamic, this paper works through the formulations that selected crisis narrative present to outline how these narratives gain dimension. The argument then moves to problematize the positioning of selective originary points within cultural studies'...",

          "In this groundbreaking and timely book, antiracist educator Robin DiAngelo deftly illuminates the phenomenon of white fragility. Referring to the defensive moves that white people make when challenged racially, white fragility is characterized by emotions such as anger, fear, and guilt, and by behaviors including argumentation and silence. These behaviors, in turn, function to reinstate white racial equilibrium and prevent any meaningful cross-racial dialogue. In this in-depth exploration, DiAngelo explores how white fragility develops, how it protects racial inequality, and what we can do to engage more constructively. –",

          "Chadderton borrowed from the seemingly contradictory scripts of critical theory and post-structural theory to claim whiteness is both an arbitrary construct and a social reality, and that scholars should make whiteness visible as such. [...]Miller (2015) wrote that when conducting critical ethnographic work about whiteness, ...it is important to state that although whites have been centred for decades in almost every aspect of our society, focus is rarely given to the racialised nature of being white. [...]students broke into the voluntary research groups in which they had been working during the fall to discuss how this workshop connected with the research they were conducting. According to this group of students, the equity statement contributed to reaffirming that superiority (i.e. \\"white people equal good\\") even as, in Mark's sarcastic words, white people are expected to \\"still be nice\\" to people who are not included in the normalized category of whiteness.

          "With global risks such as terrorism, fundamentalism, and xenophobia permeating our everyday consciousness, there is a pressing need for educators to cultivate in their students a cosmopolitan hospitality toward multiple and marginalized others in the world. Yet, despite growing interest in ethics among literary scholars, theorizations of ethical criticism are predominantly observed among scholars working in university settings rather than at high schools, and major scholarly texts on ethical criticism focus on literary texts that provoke ethical responses rather than on pedagogical strategies. In this essay, Suzanne Choo aims to address these two gaps by arguing that cosmopolitan ethical criticism should be a core feature of literature pedagogy in schools and by describing its potential for developing students as global ethical thinkers. The article situates cosmopolitan ethical criticism by distinguishing it from two other disciplinary practices, aesthetic criticism and didactic...",

Trigger warnings serve as an important means to understand the nature of universities as well as how students, professors, and administrators view the university experience. I contend that trigger warnings should be seen as campus-wide interventions, not limited only to classrooms. After all, trauma can be triggered anywhere. This article argues that the trigger warnings controversy signifies the presence of an institutional crisis for universities, especially in relation to the allocation of resources necessary to help students suffering from trauma. Debating the use of trigger warnings is one thing; however, if students feel threatened or if they suffer trauma from controversial material, then the university needs to set aside resources to help students succeed.",

          "The use of trigger warnings has been a hot topic both in academic circles and the popular press. Unfortunately, the focus has thus far been on whether or not students need to “toughen up.” The backlash trigger warnings receive is largely due to the fact that scholars and commentators alike have conflated trauma and discomfort in the classroom environment to mean the same thing. In this essay, I argue that trigger warnings should be seen primarily as a means of ensuring disability access in the classroom. In order to do so, I contend that terms such as trauma and discomfort can no longer be treated as synonyms in order to understand the ways in which trigger warnings alert students to utilize their coping strategies. The inability to recognize the necessity of trigger warnings stems largely from some instructors’ failure to identify their own privileges. Writing from and through my own embodied experiences, I seek to find clarity in existing conversations in support of trigger warnings and refocus the discussion toward equal access to an education.",

There are two central arguments: first, that the librarian ethic of \\"selection\\"—introduced by Lester Asheim in 1953 as a counterpoint to censorship—has contributed to the unfortunate construction of the censor as a \\"moron\\" and second, that anticensorship efforts more generally tend toward uncritical canon-making, attributing value to books simply because they've been censored or (more typically) challenged.",

          "This study sought to determine how preservice teachers select multicultural children’s literature, as well as how preservice teachers respond to multicultural instruction. The qualitative study gathered information and experiences from two groups: Focus Group A and Focus Group B, both of whom were enrolled in a required children’s literature course in a teacher education program in a 4-year university in Northeast Alabama. The study collected data on the strategies preservice teachers use when selecting multicultural children’s picturebooks before and after receiving a series of multicultural instruction sessions. The study also collected data on the preservice teachers’ responses to said multicultural instruction sessions. Results from the preservice teachers’ questionnaires, interviews, and worksamples indicated there was some change that occurred in both focus groups in their understanding of multicultural literature, but both groups still showed lack of understanding in applying their learning to the selection of multicultural picturebooks. Participants in the study received approximately 15 hours of multicultural instruction during a summer course term. Participants were engaged in both direct and indirect instruction of multicultural literature instruction. Findings from this study can be used by teacher educators, inservice teachers, and preservice teachers to inform practice. Future research should apply the multicultural instruction sessions to long-term studies with a larger number of participants.",

          "(Re)Imagining the world: Children’s Literature’s Response to Changing Times considers how writers of fiction for children imagine ‘the world’, not one universal world, but different worlds: imaginary, strange, familiar, even monstrous worlds. The chapters in this collection discuss how fiction for children engages with some of the changes brought about by new technologies, information literacy, consumerism, migration, politics, different family structures, cosmopolitanism, and new and old monsters. They also invite us to think about how memory shapes our understanding of the past, and how fiction engages our emotions, our capacity to empathize, our desire to discover, and what the future may hold. The contributors bring different perspectives from education, postcolonial studies, literary criticism, cultural studies, childhood studies, postmodernism, and the social sciences. With a wide coverage of texts from different countries, and scholarly and lively discussions, this collection is itself a testament to the power of the human imagination and the significance of children’s literature in the education of young people. .",

Through an analysis of textual and media searches as well as extensive research on paid online advertising, Noble exposes a culture of racism and sexism in the way discoverability is created online. As search engines and their related companies grow in importance-operating as a source for email, a major vehicle for primary and secondary school learning, and beyond-understanding and reversing these disquieting trends and discriminatory practices is of utmost importance. An original, surprising and, at times, disturbing account of bias on the internet, Algorithms of Oppression contributes to our understanding of how racism is created, maintained, and disseminated in the 21st century.

          "Gillespie interviews author of the audiobook's A Trick of Light, Kat Rosenfield talks about the book, collaborating with the godfather of superheroes, and about how cancel culture has infiltrated the literary world. She said Trick of Light is a story centered in digital culture in the internet age. In it they meet a young man named Cameron who's an aspiring YouTube star, and they meet a young woman named Nia whose history and origins are a little bit more mysterious. Together, they form a connection that could either change the world, save the world, or destroy the world entirely. She added that one of the plot points in the book is that after Cameron and Nia team up with their respective abilities, hacking and otherwise, they make it a point to go after people who are behaving badly online, who are hypocrites, who are cruel, who are victimizing other people.",

          "his analysis of Foucault's 'What is an Author?' produces three main findings. First, Foucault was arguing–subtly yet powerfully–against Barthes's 'The Death of the Author'. Second, 'What is an author?' systematically mystified the figure of the text, even as it clarified the figure of the author by revealing that figure to be an interpretative construct. Third, Foucault's achievement was vitiated by the terms in which it was cast, for his concept of the 'author-function' obliterated the personal quality of the author-figure. It is suggested in conclusion that all such interpretative figures–'text' as well as 'author', and many others besides–merit critical analysis, since these embody the fore-having which precedes interpretation.",

I draw on my own experience as a transsexual woman teaching at a conservative school, as well as contemporary psychological theory and ethics. I argue that trigger warnings are not detrimental to freedom of speech (as others, such as Dr. Vatz here, contend) and that they are in fact necessary for the well-being of some students. Moreover, judicial use of warnings can enhance classroom participation and discussion, and the intellectual development of students and faculty.",

We also meet the pockets of kids attempting to turn the tables on the cocksure corporations that so cynically strive to manipulate them.

          ", Abstract:, This paper explores the ways in which critical race theory (CRT) is used in the We Need Diverse Books (WNDB) campaign, which targets children's literature. WNDB has uniquely connected with its community from the beginning. By examining the campaign through the lens of CRT, the paper contributes points of action for library and information science (LIS) professionals to help support WNDB's momentum. It wishes to incite a sense of urgency in LIS professionals to better understand and utilize the depth of CRT's power to create a more equitable society for the community of youth that LIS practitioners serve. The push for diverse children's books is not a new one and has been championed by many for decades. One of these champions was Charlemae Rollins, an African American children's librarian at the Hall Branch Library, the first Chicago Public Library branch to open in an African American neighborhood, in 1932. However, only recently has the diverse-books issue achieved traction, thanks in part to the efforts of WNDB. LIS scholars and practitioners must ensure that this traction continues.",

          "Emma Watson started Our Shared Shelf (OSS), a feminist book club, on Goodreads in 2016. Through her work on gender-equality, Watson has accumulated enough cultural capital to be viewed as a legitimate tastemaker in selecting books for a feminist audience, and fits into what Rehberg Sedo describes as the trusted other (Rehberg Sedo, 2004). However, this article argues that Watson creates cultural hierarchies, and extends her feminist brand, through her book choices and the way that she interacts with the OSS community. Despite attempts to diversify the bi-monthly book choices, there has been a preference towards English-language books written by cisgendered, middle-class, able-bodied, heterosexual, white women. Therefore, the list did not represent the international and intersectional nature of OSS: something several readers voice concern about. Additionally, this article examines how the readers’ relationship to their celebrity tastemaker reinforces hierarchies. Engaging in social media can be a performative act: users can construct an identity whilst engaging with social issues. However, there is a danger that a dominant narrative can influence identities and interpretations. Consequently, OSS replicates and upholds patterns of dominance and exclusion and is not an egalitarian space, despite framing itself as one.",

In this vein, the Caldecott Medal is one of the most highly esteemed recognitions bestowed on children's picture books each year in the United States. Relatively few studies have examined how race is represented among main characters in Caldecott books. Using a Critical Content Analysis (CCA), we examine how race is represented among main characters in 80 Caldecott books from 1938 to 2017. Findings indicate that an overwhelmingly disproportionate percentage of the characters are White. In addition, the non-White main characters are portrayed in very narrow roles. Implications for teachers to consider when using these books are discussed.",

          "Intercultural training poses a special challenge due to the fact that it is most often attempted in isolation from the new culture. This experience gap, which those involved with intercultural training will readily recognize, is the focus of this article. Can quality, imaginative fiction be a source to bridge this pedagogical chasm between the \\"we\\" and the \\"they?\\" Nothing can take the place of actual experience, but until that most important facility is available, engaging fiction can provide a type of virtual learning. If the human brain can be likened to the hardware, then imaginative, interculturally oriented fiction, is the software. Intercultural competencies can be better achieved by evoking the imagination of the culture learner through the vicarious experience afforded through good fiction. This article will offer a sampling from the vast body of culturally significant literature to see how such works could support the training process. These practical examples from a variety of genres will be couched in the framework of a transformative training theory that is workable. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.",

          "Allusions are often translated literally while their connotative and pragmatic meaning is largely ignored. This frequently leads to culture bumps, in other words, to puzzling or impenetrable wordings. Culture Bumps discusses this problem and how to deal with a culture-specific, source-text allusion in such a way that readers of the target text can understand the function and meaning of the allusive passage. The main focus is on translators and readers as active participants in the communicative process, and the book contains interviews with professional translators as well as empirical data on the responses of real readers. Examples provide teachers who want to take up the problem in translation classes with materials from contemporary English texts, both fiction and non-fiction, as well as a flowchart of translation strategies. The conclusion recommends that translators should take the needs of readers into account when choosing translation strategies for allusions, and that university-level language teaching and translator training should pay more attention to the biculturalisation of students",

          "This article analyzes the 2002 Coretta Scott King Award book by Mildred Taylor entitled The Land. The novel and its author are situated within a tradition of historical fiction written by and about African Americans. I then offer an analysis that utilizes Critical Race Theory as an interpretive tool for examining the ways Taylor embeds meanings of land ownership into the novel. In particular the following themes emerged: (1) inspiration and adoration, (2) entitlement and privilege, and (3) freedom and security. The conclusion addresses the importance of applying Critical Race Theory to literary studies as well as identifying ways to purposefully incorporate African American young adult historical fiction within today's classrooms. © 2008 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.",

          "The Souls of White Folk: African American Writers Theorize Whitenessis the first study to consider the substantial body of African American writing that critiques whiteness as social construction and racial identity. Arguing against the prevailing approach to these texts that says African American writers retreated from issues of \\"race\\" when they wrote about whiteness, Veronica T. Watson instead identifies this body of literature as an African American intellectual and literary tradition that she names \\"the literature of white estrangement.\\" In chapters that theorize white double consciousness (W. E. B. Du Bois and Charles Chesnutt), white womanhood and class identity (Zora Neale Hurston and Frank Yerby), and the socio-spatial subjectivity of southern whites during the civil rights era (Melba Patillo Beals), Watson explores the historically situated theories and analyses of whiteness provided by the literature of white estrangement from the late nineteenth through the mid-twentieth centuries. She argues that these texts are best understood as part of a multipronged approach by African American writers to challenge and dismantle white supremacy in the United States and demonstrates that these texts have an important place in the growing field of critical whiteness studies.",

          "From Abraham Lincoln's wry observation that Harriet Beecher Stowe was \\"the little lady who made this big war\\" to Mark Twain's \\"wild proposition\\" that Walter Scott had somehow touched off sectional hostilities, there have been many competing theories about the impact of literature on nineteenth-century American society. In this provocative book, Kenneth W. Warren argues that the rise of literary realism late in the century was shaped by and in turn helped to shape the politics of racial difference following Reconstruction. Taking up a variety of novelists from this period, including most prominently Henry James and William Dean Howells, Warren demonstrates that even works not directly concerned with race were instrumental in forging a Jim Crow nation. As a literary history, Black and White Strangers places the writing of realistic novels within the context of their serialization in the monthly magazines of the 1880s. By viewing these novels in light of editorial policies regarding social propriety, national unity, and literary aesthetics, Warren reveals the often surprising ways in which realistic fiction at once challenged and abetted the growing conservatism of racial politics. Warren also seeks to bridge the gap between American and African-American literary studies, which have hitherto been \\"strangers\\" to each other. James and Howells, he argues, can be understood fully only when read alongside W.E.B. Du Bois and Frances E.W. Harper",

          "This article utilizes W.E.B. Du Bois's often-overlooked classic essay \\"The Souls of White Folk\\" to develop a long overdue dialogue between Africana studies and critical white studies. It demonstrates the dialectical nature of Du Bois's philosophy of race and critical race theory by comparing and contrasting his groundbreaking critiques of racism in The Souls of Black Folk with his reconstructed and decidedly more radical critique of the political economy of race, racism, whiteness, and white supremacy in \\"The Souls of White Folk.\\" The conception and critique of white supremacy that the author develops in this article does not seek to sidestep socio-legal race discourse as much as it intends to supplement it with the work of Du Bois et al. in philosophy of race, sociology of race, radical politics, and critical social theory. One of the main reasons this supplemental approach to critical white studies and critical race theory is important is because typically legal or lawfocused studies of race confine theorists to particular political, social, national, and/or disciplinary discursive arenas, which is extremely problematic considering the fact that white supremacy is an international imperialist or global racist system.",

          "In this article I argue that despite the claims of some, all whites in racialized societies \\"have race.\\" But because of the current context of race in our society, I argue that scholars of \\"whiteness\\" face several difficult theoretical and methodological challenges. First is the problem of how to avoid essentializing race when talking about whites as a social collective. That is, scholars must contend with the challenge of how to write about what is shared by those racialized as white without implying that their experiences of racialization all will be the same. Second, within the current context of color-blind racial discourse, researchers must confront the reality that some whites claim not to experience their whiteness at all. Third, studies of whiteness must not be conducted in a vacuum: racial discourse or \\"culture\\" cannot be separated from material realities. Only by attending to and by recognizing these challenges will empirical research on whiteness be able to push the boundaries of our understandings about the role of whites as racial actors and thereby also contribute to our understanding of how race works more generally.",

She grew up in majority-white schools, organizations, and churches, and has spent her life navigating America's racial divide as a writer, a speaker, and an expert helping organizations practice genuine inclusion. While so many institutions claim to value diversity in their mission statements, many fall short of matching actions to words. Brown highlights how white middle-class evangelicalism has participated in the rise of racial hostility, and encourages the reader to confront apathy and recognize God's ongoing work in the world.",

Yet what constitutes safety is rarely defined or contextualized. In the absence of this contextualization, the goal of safety is most often driven by White participants who complain that they are (or fear being) 'attacked' in these discussions. This article examines this specific complaint, which we term as the discourse of violence.

Mary Kate McGowan identifies a previously overlooked mechanism by which speech constitutes, rather than merely causes, harm. She argues that speech constitutes harm when it enacts a norm that prescribes that harm. McGowan illustrates this theory by considering many categories of speech including sexist remarks, racist hate speech, pornography, verbal triggers for stereotype threat, micro-aggressions, political dog whistles, slam poetry, and even the hanging of posters. 'Just Words' explores a variety of harms - such as oppression, subordination, discrimination, domination, harassment, and marginalisation - and ways in which these harms can be remedied.",

          "Do appeals that subtly invoke negative racial stereotypes shift whites’ political attitudes by harnessing their racial prejudice? Though widely cited in academic and popular discourse, prior work finds conflicting evidence for this “dog-whistle hypothesis.” Here we test the hypothesis in two experiments (total N = 1,797) in which white Americans’ racial attitudes were measured two weeks before they read political messages in which references to racial stereotypes were implicit, explicit, or not present at all. Our findings suggest that implicit racial appeals can harness racial resentment to influence policy views, though specifically among racially resentful white liberals. That dog-whistle effects would be concentrated among liberals was not predicted in advance, but this finding appears across two experiments testing effects of racial appeals in policy domains—welfare and gun control—that differ in the extent and ways they have been previously racialized. We also find evidence that the same group occasionally responded to explicit racial appeals even though these appeals were recognized as racially insensitive. We conclude by discussing implications for contemporary American politics, presenting representative survey data showing that racially resentful, white liberals were particularly likely to switch from voting for Barack Obama in 2012 to Donald Trump in 2016.",

          "Dog whistling, a form of symbolic communication through seemingly innocuous terms is a common practice for members of far-right movements. This chapter examines how dog whistling was used on Twitter during the 2016 presidential election through a virtual ethnographic approach. Dog whistling serves to circumvent censorship by automated moderation, and adapts historical markers of the far-right as well as symbols used in other media to work within Twitter’s affordances. Thus, Twitter is employed as a channel to spread hate and signal belonging among far-right communities. In doing so, creative use is made of the platform’s technology, in the face of the site’s moderation techniques, to convey white supremacist ideas to a broader audience while staying under the radar of detection.",

          "This thesis uses ethnographic research into online media fandom, focusing on self-reflexive analytical documents that fans call meta, to investigate longstanding questions about the nature of virtual community. It argues that virtual documents should be seen as complete and complex interactions in their original form and as social contexts in their own right, and presents a new approach to ethnographic methodology and ethics suited to working in this context. Fans have incorporated various technologies into the infrastructure that constitutes their community, and these have had various effects on the structure and substance of fannish documents and interactions – and on the character of the community as a whole. The stability and visibility of the digital archive is an important feature of virtual community – one that makes fandom more visible, accessible, and historically grounded for both old and new members. This research also deals with conflict, not as a necessarily divisive force but as a natural and important part of how communities evolve and how members negotiate and articulate what their community should be. It discusses fanfiction as a controversial and sometimes problematic genre, and considers trigger warnings as the solution fans have developed to protect vulnerable members of their community from potentially harmful content (such as rape). It also examines conflict with outside authorities, like creators and the administrators who control the virtual spaces that fans inhabit. These conflicts illuminate creativity and feminism as fannish values, presenting fandom as a community that embraces sex-positive female sexuality. More importantly, they suggest that the creation and maintenance of a ‘safe space’ where all members feel respected and comfortable is a key feature of online community. In addition, fannish storytelling (particularly the creation of what fans call fanon) is part of the production of local knowledge, of boundary mechanisms that mark and separate members of the community from outsiders. These stories as part of the process by which fans position themselves within the broader community – and in so doing, locate themselves within smaller cohorts of fans who affirm and support aspects of their personal experiences and marginalised identities (e.g. as women, members of the LGBTQIA+ community, or people of colour) through the reorientation and appropriation of story.",

          "How the essential democratic values of diversity and free expression can coexist on campus.Safe spaces, trigger warnings, microaggressions, the disinvitation of speakers, demands to rename campus landmarks—debate over these issues began in lecture halls and on college quads but ended up on op-ed pages in the New York Times and the Wall Street Journal, on cable news, and on social media. Some of these critiques had merit, but others took a series of cheap shots at “crybullies” who needed to be coddled and protected from the real world. Few questioned the assumption that colleges must choose between free expression and diversity. In Safe Spaces, Brave Spaces, John Palfrey argues that the essential democratic values of diversity and free expression can, and should, coexist on campus. Palfrey, currently Head of School at Phillips Academy, Andover, and formerly Professor and Vice Dean at Harvard Law School, writes that free expression and diversity are more compatible than opposed. Free expression can serve everyone—even if it has at times been dominated by white, male, Christian, heterosexual, able-bodied citizens. Diversity is about self-expression, learning from one another, and working together across differences",

          "What is whiteness? Why is it worth using as a tool in the social sciences? Making sociological sense of the idea of whiteness, this book skilfully argues how this concept can help us understand contemporary societies. If one of sociology's objectives is to make the familiar unfamiliar in order to gain heightened understanding, then whiteness offers a perfect opportunity to do so. Leaning firstly on the North American corpus, this key book critically engages with writings on the formation of white identities in Britain, Ireland and the Americas, using multidisciplinary sources. Empirical work done in the UK, including the author's own, is developed in order to suggest how whiteness functions in Britain. Bringing an emphasis on empirical work to a heavily theorized area, this important text synthesizes and reviews existing work, incorporates multidisciplinary sources of interest to those outside the sociology sphere, and features concise chapters which will engage undergraduates. Garner deftly argues that whiteness is a multifaceted, contingent and fluid identity, and that it must be incorporated into any contemporary understandings of racism as a system of power relationships in both its local and global forms.",

          "In 1989, Kimberlé Williams Crenshaw published “Demarginalizing the Intersection of Race and Sex: A Black Feminist Critique of Antidiscrimination Doctrine, Feminist Theory and Antiracist Politics.” Because Crenshaw’s intervention focused on highlighting how Black women are structurally disadvantaged in both law and civil rights discourses, some scholars have marginalized intersectionality by assuming that the theory concerns only Black women, or only race and gender, and by arguing that intersectionality conceptualizes those social categories in fixed and static ways. These interpretations both misdescribe Crenshaw’s articulation of intersectionality and conflate the work a general theory of intersectionality might perform with the specific work Crenshaw mobilized her theory to do. To challenge these narrow readings of intersectionality, this essay examines how law and civil rights advocacy produce racialized modes of gender normativity. More specifically, I employ intersectionality to engage men, masculinity, whiteness and sexual orientation—social categories that are ostensibly beyond the theoretical reach and normative concern of intersectionality. My aim is to show the ways in which formal equality frameworks in law and civil rights advocacy produce and entrench normative gender identities. Colorblindness and masculinity are deeply implicated in this. I introduce two concepts—colorblind intersectionality and gender-blind intersectionality—to illustrate how. Colorblind intersectionality refers to instances in which whiteness helps to produce and is part of a cognizable social category but is invisible or unarticulated as an intersectional subject position. For example, white heterosexual men constitute a cognizable social category whose whiteness is rarely seen or expressed in intersectional terms. Gender-blind intersectionality describes a similar intersectional elision with respect to gender. By linking intersectionality to a critique of formal equality, colorblindness, and gender normativity, this essay relocates intersectionality as both a product and an articulation of critical race theory.",

          "In a racialized social system, racial slurs and stereotypes applied to whites by nonwhites do not carry the same meanings or outcomes as they do when these roles are swapped. That is, racial epithets directed toward whites are unlikely to affect their life chances in the same way that racial epithets directed toward minorities do. Our central question in this paper is in what ways are epithets and stereotypes racially unequal? To answer this question, we rely upon a case study to drive our analysis. We argue that the symbolic meanings and outcomes of epithets and stereotypes matter because they maintain white supremacy in both material and symbolic ways. Thus, they serve as resources that impose, confer, deny, and approve other capital rewards in everyday interactions that ultimately exclude racial minorities, blacks and Latinas/os in particular, from opportunities and resources while preserving white supremacy.",

          "Social scientists have traditionally argued that whiteness—the attribute of being recognized and treated as a White person in society—is powerful because it is invisible. On this view, members of the racially dominant group have the unique luxury of rarely noticing their race or the privileges it confers. This article challenges this \\"invisibility thesis,\\" arguing that Whites frequently regard themselves as racial actors. We further argue that whiteness defines a problematic social identity that confronts Whites with 2 psychological threats: the possibility that their accomplishments in life were not fully earned (meritocratic threat) and the association with a group that benefits from unfair social advantages (groupimage threat). We theorize that Whites manage their racial identity to dispel these threats. According to our deny, distance, or dismantle (3D) model of White identity management, dominant-group members have three strategies at their disposal: deny the existence of privilege, distance their own self-concepts from the White category, or strive to dismantle systems of privilege. Whereas denial and distancing promote insensitivity and inaction with respect to racial inequality, dismantling reduces threat by relinquishing privileges. We suggest that interventions aimed at reducing inequality should attempt to leverage dismantling as a strategy of White identity management.",

It highlights the dialectical nature of Fordham and Ogbu's philosophy of race and critical race theory by locating the origins of the “burden of \`acting White' ” in the work of W.E.B. Du Bois, who provides some of the intellectual foundations for this work. Following the work of F. W. Twine and C. Gallagher (2008), I then survey the field of critical whiteness studies and outline an emerging third wave in this interdisciplinary field. This new wave of research utilizes the following five elements that form its basic core: (1) the centrality of race and racism and their intersectionality with other forms of oppression",

Feminist and postcolonial scholars have offered powerful critiques of the language of diversity. This essay aims to contribute to the debate by examining how diversity workers work with the term 'diversity' within the context of education. It shows that diversity as a term is used strategically by practitioners as a solution to what has been called 'equity fatigue'",

          "Northrop Frye's long career made him Canada's most creative public intellectual. A century after his birth, his many books demonstrate a powerful vision of the resources of the human imagination. Frye's critical theory sought the continuities linking human creation in all spheres of life, trusting in the idea of a single human community sharing myths, stories, and images that express shared visions and desires. The essays in Educating the Imagination illustrate the extraordinary range of Frye's ideas. Robert Bringhurst examines how Frye mapped the mind, Ian Balfour considers what \\"belief\\" meant for Frye, and Gordon Teskey re-examines two of the critic's great subjects - Blake and Milton. Michael Dolzani and Thomas Willard discuss Frye's symbolism, and Robert Tally looks at his utopianism. A strong thread running through all the essays is Frye's interest in the Romantic era, as Mark Ittenson shows. Three essays pair Frye with other titans of the time: Fredric Jameson, Paul de Man, and Jacques Derrida. Troni Y. Grande examines a gender issue in Frye's theory of tragedy, and J. Edward Chamberlin concludes by relating Frye's writings to songs, ceremonies of belief, and the common ground that they represent across cultures. Engaging with significant matters of contemporary concern, Educating the Imagination provides a renewed understanding of Northrop Frye and the fertility of his ideas about the imagination and society. Contributors include Ian Balfour (York), Robert Bringhurst, Adam Carter (Lethbridge), J. Edward Chamberlin (Toronto), Alexander Dick (British Columbia), Michael Dolzani (Baldwin Wallace), Troni Y. Grande (Regina), Mark Ittensohn (Zurich), Garry Sherbert (Regina), Robert T. Tally, Jr., (Texas State), Gordon Teskey (Harvard), and Thomas Willard (Arizona).",

John M. Ellis here scrutinizes the new regime in humanistic studies. He offers a careful, intelligent analysis that exposes the weaknesses of notions that are fashionable in humanities today. In a clear voice, with forceful logic, he speaks out against the orthodoxy that has installed race, gender, and class perspectives at the center of college humanities curricula.Ellis begins by showing that political correctness is a recurring impulse of Western society and one that has a discouraging history. He reveals the contradictions and misconceptions that surround the new orthodoxy and demonstrates how it is most deficient just where it imagines itself to be superior. Ellis contends that humanistic education today, far from being historically aware, relies on anachronistic thinking",

          "How to Read African American Literature offers a series of provocations to unsettle the predominant assumptions readers make when encountering post-Civil Rights black fiction. Foregrounding the large body of literature and criticism that grapples with legacies of the slave past, Aida Levy-Hussen’s argument develops on two levels: as a textual analysis of black historical fiction, and as a critical examination of the reading practices that characterize the scholarship of our time. Drawing on psychoanalysis, memory studies, and feminist and queer theory, Levy-Hussen examines how works by Toni Morrison, David Bradley, Octavia Butler, Charles Johnson, and others represent and mediate social injury and collective grief. In the criticism that surrounds these novels, she identifies two major interpretive approaches: “therapeutic reading” (premised on the assurance that literary confrontations with historical trauma will enable psychic healing in the present), and “prohibitive reading” (anchored in the belief that fictions of returning to the past are dangerous and to be avoided). Levy-Hussen argues that these norms have become overly restrictive, standing in the way of a more supple method of interpretation that recognizes and attends to the indirect, unexpected, inconsistent, and opaque workings of historical fantasy and desire. Moving beyond the question of whether literature must heal or abandon historical wounds, Levy-Hussen proposes new ways to read African American literature now.",

Could a nursery rhyme like Baa Baa Black Sheep be full of concealed loathing, resentment, and aggression? In this accessible, delightfully entertaining book, Terry Eagleton addresses these intriguing questions and a host of others. How to Read Literature is the book of choice for students new to the study of literature and for all other readers interested in deepening their understanding and enriching their reading experience.In a series of brilliant analyses, Eagleton shows how to read with due attention to tone, rhythm, texture, syntax, allusion, ambiguity, and other formal aspects of literary works. He also examines broader questions of character, plot, narrative, the creative imagination, the meaning of fictionality, and the tension between what works of literature say and what they show. Unfailingly authoritative and cheerfully opinionated, the author provides useful commentaries on classicism, Romanticism, modernism, and postmodernism along with spellbinding insights into a huge range of authors, from Shakespeare and J. K. Rowling to Jane Austen and Samuel Beckett.",

She does not reduce fiction to a functional support for ideology, however, but considers that the greatest interest in fiction is as a source of pleasure. She discusses both 'high' and 'low' fiction, combining discussion of social context with language analysis. Taking a view of fiction as a product of social practices, the book examines not only the texts themselves but also what people do with them and how they are valued. Fictions at work will be of interest to students on a variety of courses including linguistics, English, women's studies, cultural studies, and media and communication studies.",

From there, we introduce the theory and provide illustrative participant data examples. These data examples illustrate the four cultural positions middle grade students in our research assumed when responding to salient textual features embedded in African American children’s novels. Our theory suggests that because a range of cultural positions factors into students’ meaning making, we should mine texts more carefully for cultural milieu as well as find acceptance with a broader range of literary interpretations. We conclude by discussing implications for literary researchers and practitioners who study or use multicultural children’s literature.",

The literature presented in this article cuts across the disciplines of education as well as English and library science. Using the selective tradition as a theoretical underpinning, the authors review extant literature through a three-pronged thematic heuristic developed as a result of their analysis. These themes present research findings related to African American children's literature as (1) contested terrain, (2) cultural artifact, and (3) literary art. The three themes generated to delineate the findings derived from a four-stage iterative process of analysis. By considering collective findings, a more careful and continued institutionalization of this literature can take place in schools, libraries, bookstores, popular media, and within families. The authors also address future implications for educational practice and research related to African American children's literature.",

          "To commemorate the 50th anniversary of the Journal of Literacy Research, this article reviews the trajectory of a particular line of scholarship published in this journal over the past five decades. We focus on African diaspora youth literature to contemplate and extend the ways in which literacy researchers carry out textual analysis research of diverse children’s and young adult literature. We situate this line of scholarship (and its trajectory) within the broader literacy field and then narrow to a focus on diverse books. Next, to turn our gaze as literacy researchers forward to the future, we present our own critical content analysis of a young adult text collection. Our analysis incorporates postcolonial theory and a youth lens to interrogate how underlying ideologies identified within the novels support, refute, or reconstruct dominant beliefs about Black girls. We end with a set of implications for researchers interested in theorizing about or further investigating diverse children’s or young adult literature.",

          "Fazekas and Vena evaluate the impact of Catherine Hardwicke’s Twilight in light of the ongoing cultural assumption that women do not engage with horror. Contextualizing the film against a contemporary wave of women-directed horror, the chapter analyzes how Hardwicke’s Twilight uses its central heroine, Bella, to re-prioritize female expressions of desire and pleasure within the genre. Although male fans and horror critics have dismissed the film, the breadth of female-authored fan fiction testifies to its importance. Looking at the fan fiction trope of ‘the Mary Sue,’ the authors show how female horror fans derive pleasure from the text, and how this engagement prompts a re-negotiation of horror’s boundaries, affects and audience.",

The film’s central image is the ‘sunken place,’ a form of social death depicted as a void within which black subjectivity is constricted and isolated while a white person controls his/her fate. This chapter explores how the film and promotional strategies construct both black subjectivity and the moral monsters that would systematically degrade a class of human beings without remorse. It shows that racial politics in Get Out falls on the critical cross line between Night of the Living Dead (1968) and the Black Lives Matter movement.",

          "Drawing on recently established zine archives and oral-history interviews with former girl zine producers, as well as with zine librarians, archivists, and commentators, this essay explores the significance of the fact that dissident girls and young women developed an interest in what are now called “girl zines” through a number of different routes, with a range of different interests, and at different moments over the course of the last twenty-five years. Some were directly inspired by riot grrrl bands in the early 1990s. Others happened upon zines at alternative bookstores and info-shops and as part of their participation in the larger punk underground. Still others learned of them through popular magazines, college courses, and public and private libraries, or through quite varied friendship networks. The fact of this social, material, and temporal variability raises important questions about whether “girl zines” should be thought of as a unitary genre and, correlatively, about whether the girl zine explosion itself should be construed as a secondary effect of the riot grrrl phenomenon of the early 1990s. Building on recent critiques made by punks and zinesters of color of the now-dominant narrative about the history of riot grrrl and the role of zines within it, the essay traces how that narrative developed in the context of a backlash against feminism and how it led, ultimately, to the creation of the genre now known as “girl zines” and the founding of archives designed to ensure their preservation. Though both are seen as significant political achievements for feminism, by considering Mimi Thi Nguyen's recent claim that the dominant narrative and the genealogies it constructs tend to ignore the important but often differently motivated contributions of punks and zinesters of color, the essay explores the question of what it might mean to focus on the varied itineraries that girls pursued into the punk underground and on how those itineraries affected the zines they created for often quite distinct purposes. Ultimately, the essay asks how riot grrrl and girl zine-ing ought to be understood. That is, should they be construed as a singular event, as a coherent social movement, as a fractious discourse, as a complex set of social practices, as a political intervention, or as something else? In the end, the author argues that attending to the disagreements and contestations among girl punks and zinesters who constantly called each other out over their differences suggests that as a youthful cohort profoundly affected by the vast social and cultural change associated with what is now call neoliberalism, these young people were arguing among themselves and with the surrounding culture over how to craft new, more flexible forms of subjectivity and sociality adequate to the challenges of the twenty-first century.",

          "In this paper, I offer my own counterstory of matriculating through a teacher education program as an African American student on a predominately White campus as a reference point for thinking through how racism operates through teacher education’s dominant discourse and practice of teacher reflection. It is an important story to tell primarily because it touches on a largely unexplored dimension of teacher reflection. While the large majority of the literature has focused on how to prepare White preservice teachers to teach in a culturally and racially complex world, little qualitative attention has been given to the preparation of nonwhite students. While there are a few select and important articles that touch on some of the challenges African American students face in predominately White teacher education programs, including covert and overt racism, none focus on how teacher reflection might reproduce these dynamics. Thus what the literature on teacher reflection often suggests is that it is a racially neutral practice. In this essay, however, I suggests otherwise, by providing an intimate and critical look at my process of learning to be a reflective practitioner. The question I seek to grapple with is quite simply, “What does teacher reflection work to repress?”",

          "Teacher educators are constantly trying to improve the field to meet the needs of a growing urban populace. Inclusion of socially just philosophies in the curriculum is indeed essential, yet it can mask the recycling of normalized, oppressive Whiteness. This reflective and theoretical paper employs critical race theory and critical Whiteness studies to deconstruct Whiteness, abuse, and love in teacher education. Using an interdisciplinary and emotion-based approach to understanding Whiteness, this paper examines how denying race during white childhood via a color-blind ideology leaves lasting emotional scars, impressions that perpetuate the institutional silencing of race in teacher education. This \\"abuse\\" is projected onto urban students of color and, more broadly, people of color. This paper asserts that until teacher education programs make confronting and exploring Whiteness a priority, they cannot truly love their urban students of color as complete beings and so deny humanity full and just consideration.",

          "Nominated — Society of Professors of Education Outstanding Book Award 2017. Discussing race and racism often conjures up emotions of guilt, shame, anger, defensiveness, denial, sadness, dissonance, and discomfort. Instead of suppressing those feelings, coined emotionalities of whiteness , they are, nonetheless, important to identify, understand, and deconstruct if one ever hopes to fully commit to racial equity. Feeling White: Whiteness, Emotionality, and Education delves deeper into these white emotionalities and other latent ones by providing theoretical and psychoanalytic analyses to determine where these emotions so stem, how they operate, and how they perpetuate racial inequities in education and society. The author beautifully weaves in creative writing with theoretical work to artistically illustrate how these emotions operate while also engaging the reader in an emotional experience in and of itself, claiming one must feel to understand. This book does not rehash former race concepts",

          "Critical Race Theory (CRT) revolutionized how we investigate race in education. Centralizing counter-stories from people of color becomes essential for decentralizing white normative discourse-a process we refer to as realities within the Black imagination. Yet, few studies examine how whites respond to centering the Black imagination, especially since their white imagination goes unrecognized. We propose utilizing Critical Whiteness Studies (CWS) to support CRT to aid in deconstructing the dimensions of white imaginations. Our findings describe how the white imagination operates inside the minds of white teacher candidates, namely through their (a) emotional disinvestment, (b) lack of critical understanding of race, (c) resurgence of white guilt, and (d) recycling of hegemonic whiteness, all of which negatively impact their role in anti-racist teaching in urban schools.",

          "Although Critical Race Theory (CRT) has been applied to teacher education, it has yet to be meaningfully integrated into the core of urban teacher education programs. The reticence to embrace CRT is largely due to the overwhelming presence of Whiteness, despite Sleeter's (2001) demand for diversification. This theoretically interpretative article employs CRT's methodology of counterstorytelling to interrogate how Whiteness manifests itself in emotional ways, like fetishism and sentimentalization, and how such emotions are the root of resistance toward CRT in teacher education. Drawing from Black feminism and Critical Whiteness Studies, we utilize emotionally-based theories to illustrate the importance of CRT in teacher education, to identify barriers to CRT, and to recommend how teacher education can more genuinely reinvest in antiracism.",

          "Drawing on one of the author's experiences of teaching white teacher candidates in an urban university, this paper argues for the importance of interrogating the ways that benign emotions (e.g., pity and caring) are sometimes hidden expressions of disgust for the Other. Using critical race theory, whiteness studies, and critical emotion studies, it is shown how whiteness ideology erroneously translates disgust for people of color to false professions of pity or caring. This phenomenon is particularly interesting because care, sympathy, and love are emotions that are routinely performed by teacher candidates (who are predominantly white females) and embedded in teacher education. Yet not much literature theorizes how these performative emotions are not exempt of whiteness ideology. To engage in a genuine process of antiracism, we argue that the emotions that undergird teachers' dispositions need to be critically and sensitively unpacked. We end with implications for teacher education, particularly in relation to pedagogical ways of identifying and interrogating narratives of caring-as-hidden disgust and cultivating critical compassion.",

          "This paper explores the ways in which critical race theory (CRT) is used in the We Need Diverse Books (WNDB) campaign, which targets children's literature. WNDB has uniquely connected with its community from the beginning. By examining the campaign through the lens of CRT, the paper contributes points of action for library and information science (LIS) professionals to help support WNDB's momentum. It wishes to incite a sense of urgency in LIS professionals to better understand and utilize the depth of CRT's power to create a more equitable society for the community of youth that LIS practitioners serve. The push for diverse children's books is not a new one and has been championed by many for decades. One of these champions was Charlemae Rollins, an African American children's librarian at the Hall Branch Library, the first Chicago Public Library branch to open in an African American neighborhood, in 1932. However, only recently has the diverse-books issue achieved traction, thanks in part to the efforts of WNDB. LIS scholars and practitioners must ensure that this traction continues.",

          "Taking a critical, research-oriented perspective, this exploration of the theoretical, empirical, and pedagogical connections between the reading and teaching of young adult literature and adolescent identity development centers around three key questions: Who are the teens reading young adult literature? Why should teachers teach young adult literature? Why are teens reading young adult literature? All chapters work simultaneously on two levels: each provides both a critical resource about contemporary young adult literature that could be used in YA literature classes or workshops and specific practical suggestions about what texts to use and how to teach them effectively in middle and high school classes. Theorizing, problematizing, and reflecting in new ways on the teaching and reading of young adult literature in middle and secondary school classrooms, this valuable resource for teachers and teacher educators will help them to develop classrooms where students use literature as a means of making sense of themselves, each other, and the world around them.",

All of these words that we hear-'literacy,' 'inclusion,' 'diversity'-those are all words for connection ... When I say to people 'why do we need to have diverse books?' it's not because necessarily everybody needs to see themselves reflected in every book, but because we need that sense of connection. We need to live in a global sense.\\" In 2014 Chris Myers and his late great father, the groundbreaking renowned author Walter Dean Myers, published a widely read pair of companion pieces in The New York Times: \\"The Apartheid of Children's Literature\\" and \\"Where Are the People of Color in Children's Books?\\" I was grateful that Chris Myers joined other leading children's book authors at a roundtable before 2,000 college-age students, public school teachers, and juvenile detention personnel preparing to teach in summer Children's Defense Fund Freedom Schools programs. Our reading curriculum has long been centered on excellent books reflecting a wide variety of cultures, races, and experiences. For some children it is the first time they have seen books with characters who look like them and share some of the struggles in their lives. Our goal is to help children fall in love with reading, and they respond. \\"I enjoyed learning about my history.\\" \\"That [book] really inspired me because he came from a rough neighborhood.\\" \\"Freedom Schools taught me when I learn, I can have fun with it. It made me a better reader because I can understand things.\\" \\"I see myself and the books give me hope.\\"",

          "Young Adult literature, from The Outsiders to Harry Potter, has helped shape the cultural landscape for adolescents perhaps more than any other form of consumable media in the twentieth and twenty-first century. With the rise of mega blockbuster films based on these books in recent years, the young adult genre is being co-opted by curious adult readers and by Hollywood producers. However, while the genre may be getting more readers than ever before, Young Adult literature remains exclusionary and problematic: few titles feature historically marginalized individuals, the books present heteronormative perspectives, and gender stereotypes continue to persist. Taking a critical approach, Young Adult Literature: Challenging Genres offers educators, youth librarians, and students a set of strategies for unpacking, challenging, and transforming the assumptions of some of the genre's most popular titles. Pushing the genre forward, Antero Garcia builds on his experiences as a former high school teacher to offer strategies for integrating Young Adult literature in a contemporary critical pedagogy through the use of participatory media.",

          "Content analysis is a widely used qualitative research technique. Rather than being a single method, current applications of content analysis show three distinct approaches: conventional, directed, or summative. All three approaches are used to interpret meaning from the content of text data and, hence, adhere to the naturalistic paradigm. The major differences among the approaches are coding schemes, origins of codes, and threats to trustworthiness. In conventional content analysis, coding categories are derived directly from the text data. With a directed approach, analysis starts with a theory or relevant research findings as guidance for initial codes. A summative content analysis involves counting and comparisons, usually of keywords or content, followed by the interpretation of the underlying context. The authors delineate analytic procedures specific to each approach and techniques addressing trustworthiness with hypothetical examples drawn from the area of end-of-life care.",

          "In this research we examine how normative expressions of prejudice shape university communities. Across four studies, we examine the prevalence of a former university mascot depicting harmful stereotypes about Native Americans and how exposure to that mascot influences people's attitudes and behaviors. In Study 1, images of the mascot persist on ¿10% of university apparel worn by students, in 50% of campus spaces, and in 5% of images searched online. Surveying students on this campus, we find that students with lower (higher) reported explicit prejudice also tended to have lower (higher) belonging at the university (Study 2). In two final experimental studies (N = 683), when compared to stereotype free university advertisements exposure to the stereotypic mascot reduced donations to the university by 5.5%, and in particular, among people low versus high in explicit prejudice (Studies 3 and 4). Overall, these findings suggest that institutional norms play an important role in expressions of prejudice and experiences of belonging. •A mascot depicting Native American stereotypes is prevalent at one university campus.•Exposure to the stereotypic mascot reduced university donations by 5.5%.•People low in explicit prejudice report lower belonging when exposed to the mascot.",

          "This critical content analysis examines the representation of Latinx characters in 15 picture books published in 2013 and identified by Children's Cooperative Book Center (CCBC) as having significant Latinx content. The theoretical framework undergirding this study is Critical Race Theory (Ladson-Billings, 1998; Solórzano & Yosso, 2002; Taylor, 2009; Yosso, Villalpando, Delgado Bernal, & Solórzano, 2001). This theory is used to uncover the assumptions and ideologies that are often represented in children's literature. The results of this study indicate that (1) English is privileged in the texts, (2) superficial references to cultural artifacts are present, (3) traditional female centered roles are prevalent, and (4) authors situated books within a utopian society. The authors use these findings to argue for the importance of making curricular decisions with critical attention to text selections and the engagement of young children in critical literacy in early childhood and elementary classrooms.",

In her critical work, Morrison identifies a “sinister” tradition in which “the readers of virtually all of American fiction have been positioned as white.” From that perspective, she argues, the characters in fiction can safely be presumed white, unless the narrative explicitly indicates otherwise",

In \\"Rosa Was Tired,\\" Kohl points out the subtle racism inherent in the usual telling of the Rosa Parks story.

He provides strategies for detecting bias in other works for young people and offers powerful ideas for better ways to tell children stories",

          "Should We Burn Babar? Essays on Children's Literature and the Power of Story is a powerful, important book that addresses issues that transcend children's literature itself. Actually a collection of loosely connected essays, the book reflects author Herbert Kohl's long-time status as a passionate advocate of children and progressive educational reform. Consequently, the book has at least as much to say about American education, past and present, as it does about children's literature",

          "As a doctoral student at Wayne State University in Detroit, the author taught, along with a few other doctoral students, some of the undergraduate courses in children's literature. One year in the early 1970s, they graduate student-instructors were recruited as helpers at a book fair. Among the books to be displayed was a set of children's books, all related to African Americans, that the late Donald J. Bissett, director of the children's literature program, had named the Darker Brother collection. The exciting thing about the Darker Brother collection was that it was a sign that what Larrick (1965) had labeled the \\"all-White world\\" of children's literature was no longer all White. By the end of the decade, combined social, political, and economic forces had begun to propel the field of children's literature toward greater diversity. The numbers of contemporary children's books focused on Black characters and Black life and history were beginning to increase, offering opportunities for scholarly examinations of their content. In this article, the author reflects on her scholarship in the field of African American children's literature and the emergence of that literature as a cohesive body of work.",

Woodson has also received several awards for the body of her work, including the Astrid Lindgren Memorial Award, the Margaret A. Edwards Award, the 2018 Children's Literature Legacy Award, and the 2020 Hans Christian Andersen Award. Woodson is not afraid to embrace issues that some writers might consider too risky in ways that are always nuanced, sensitive, and hopeful- including racism, classism, incest, incarceration, death, and abandonment.",

          "Despite receiving prestigious literary awards, two historical novels for young people-Sebestyen's Words By Heart and Fox's The Slave Dancer-have evoked the bitter criticism of such politically oriented groups as the Council on Interracial Books for Children. It is claimed that these books present a distorted and inaccurate view of black culture and history. The controversies that have surrounded these books are examined and the books themselves are discussed in relation to a third novel-Taylor's Roll of Thunder, Hear My Cry, a book lauded for both its literary qualities and its perspective on black history. It is argued that the traditional evaluation and criticism of the aesthetic values of children's literature must be joined by criticism which focuses on the sociohis- torical and cultural dimensions of that literature. I suggest that any liberties or inaccuracies in historical fact taken by authors must be justified by the contribution to the aesthetic qualities of the work. These liberties or inaccuracies must also be assessed in terms of their potentially harmful impact on children. The importance of attending to the sociohistorical and cultural dimensions of literature is also made by referring to recent research on the sociology of school knowledge.",
