  abstract = {We point out a simple relation between the nuclear vertex constant (NVC) and the overall normalization of the astrophysical S factor. Using predicted values of the NVC for the virtual decay of 8B{$\rightarrow$}7Be+p we find S17(0){$\approx$}17.6 eVb for 7Be(p,{$\gamma$})8B reactions, consistent with the low values extrapolated from direct capture measurements by Filippone et al. and by Vaughn et al. New possibilities, using proton transfer reactions, to measure the astrophysical S factor indirectly are proposed.},
