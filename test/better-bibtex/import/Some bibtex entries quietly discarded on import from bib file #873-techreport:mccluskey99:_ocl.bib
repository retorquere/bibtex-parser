                  object-oriented, language for HTN planners. The work
                  is interesting and offers checking to make sure that
                  transitions are well-founded, in terms of the
                  objects that make up the domain. Somewhat limited,
                  however, in terms of the richness of the object
                  hierarchy, and the sorts of things that an HTN
                  method is allowed to do. There's a discussion of how
                  OCL$_h$ could be used to formalize O-Plan
                  operators.},
