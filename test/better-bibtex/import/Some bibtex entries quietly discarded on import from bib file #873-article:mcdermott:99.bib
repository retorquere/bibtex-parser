		  that described his search heuristic for forward
		  planners.
		  The article discusses the problem of ``attention-deficit'' 
		  in McDermott's UNPOP --- the problem of switching 
		  between goals too much.
		  Also discusses preservation goals, which we have
		  just been kludging into SA-CIRCA.}
