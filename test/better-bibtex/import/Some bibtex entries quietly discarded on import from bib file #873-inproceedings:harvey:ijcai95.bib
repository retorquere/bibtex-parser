	ANNOTE = {LDS is a search technique that iteratively makes $n$
		  decisions differently from the dictates of its heuristic, 
		  for increasing $n$.  The intuition behind LDS is that 
		  heuristics often give recommendations that are worse at
		  the start of the search than at the end.  Accordingly,
		  LDS makes divergent decisions initially at the beginning 
		  of the search path, working towards the end.  Note that
		  were this assumption wrong, depth-first search would work
		  well, because it undoes decisions first at the end of 
		  the search.  Harvey and Ginsberg also discuss combining
		  LDS with bounded-backtrack search, which they show gives
		  better behavior in large search spaces.}
