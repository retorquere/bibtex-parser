  abstract =     {Applications that require alternative plans challenge the
                  single solution, single quality metric assumptions upon which
                  many classical planners are designed and evaluated. To
                  evaluate the distinctness of alternative plans (i.e., plan
                  sets), researchers have created diversity metrics that often
                  measure the set difference between the actions of plans. Many
                  approaches for generating plan sets embed the same diversity
                  metric in a weighted evaluation function to guide the search
                  mechanism, thus confounding the search process with its
                  evaluation. We discover that two diversity metrics fail to
                  distinguish similar plans from each other or to identify plans
                  with extraneous actions, so we introduce two new diversity
                  metrics, \emph{uniqueness} and \emph{overlap}, to capture
                  these cases. We then examine the tradeoffs of producing
                  diverse plans while we control for plan length and metric
                  interaction and confirm that metric interaction can
                  significantly impact search performance.  We show that
                  planners searching for plan sets must consider a third metric,
                  \emph{parsimony}, that prefers shorter plans while maximizing
                  diversity.We evaluate three existing approaches for generating
                  diverse plans and two new algorithms that are designed to
                  explicitly manage diversity and interaction between the
                  diversity and quality metrics. Our findings synthesize and
                  extend recent results in plan diversity.},
