		 component of many planning algorithms-is the process of
		 determining that a logical sentence is false based on
		 its absence from a knowledge base, or the inability to
		 derive it. We describe a novel method for closed-world
		 inference and update over the first-order theories of
		 action used by planning algorithms such as NONLIN,
		 TWEAK, and UCPOP. We show the method to be sound and
		 efficient, but incomplete. In our experiments,
		 closed-world inference consistently averaged about 2
		 milliseconds while updates averaged approximately 1.2
		 milliseconds. Furthermore, we demonstrate that
		 incompleteness is nonproblematic in practice, since our
		 mechanism makes over 99% of the desired inferences. We
		 incorporated our method into the XII planner, which
		 supports our Internet Softbot (software robot). The
		 technique cut the number of actions executed by the
		 Softbot by a factor of one hundred, and resulted in a
		 corresponding speedup to XII.",
