  abstract =     "We explore the situation calculus within the
                 framework of inductive definability. A consequence of
                 this view of the situation calculus is to establish
                 direct connections with different variants of the mu-calculus,
                 structural operational semantics of concurrent
                 processes, and logic programming.
                 First we show that the induction principle on
                 situations is implied by an inductive
                 definition of the set of situations. Then we consider
                 the frame problem from the point of view of inductive
                 definability and by defining fluents inductively we
                 obtain essentially the same form of successor state
                 axioms as Reiter's. Our approach allows extending
                 this result to the case where ramification constraints
                 are present. Finally we demonstrate a method of
                 applying inductive definitions for computing fixed
                 point properties of GOLOG programs."
