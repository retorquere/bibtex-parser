                  problem (credit where credit is due, this was
                  identified by the authors) in having {SHOP} control
                  other agents, is that in evaluating preconditions,
                  {SHOP} must be able to project the effects of the
                  actions of other agents. However, this very
                  interesting engineering problem is just made the
                  responsibility of the ``monitoring agent'' and left
                  as an exercise for the reader.}
