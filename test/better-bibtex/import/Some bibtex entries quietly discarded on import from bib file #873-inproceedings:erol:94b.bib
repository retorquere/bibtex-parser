	ANNOTE = {Erol, et. al. discuss the complexity and expressivity
		  of HTN planning based on their UMCP planning.  They show
		  that HTN planning is strictly more expressive than 
		  simple STRIPS planning.  The reason HTN planning is more
		  expressive is that having a goal task network instead of 
		  a propositional goal allows the user of the system to 
		  specify not just what is to be achieved, but some aspects of 
		  how it is to be achieved.  They use the example that in an
		  HTN planner one can specify the goal of ``build a house,''
		  as distinct from simply ``own a house,'' which could also
		  be satisfied by ``buy a house.''  As far as expressivity 
		  is concerned, HTN planning in the general case is 
		  undecidable.  Forcing HTNs to be totally-ordered sets of
		  tasks or removing variables from the tasks can reduce the
		  complexity.
