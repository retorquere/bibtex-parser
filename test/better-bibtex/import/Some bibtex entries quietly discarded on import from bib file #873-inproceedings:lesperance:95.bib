	ANNOTE = {The article provides an outline of the application of
		  Scherl and Levesque's work on knowledge-producing actions 
		  and Reiter and Lin's work on the frame problem, to agent
		  programming.  The central limitation of the work is that
		  they have little to say about the generation of new 
		  plans/programs for agent actions --- they center their 
		  discussion around the use of the logic for verification
		  of agent programs.}
