	ANNOTE = {Etzioni et. al. provide a notion of dynamic 
		  closed-world reasoning.  They do this by having, in
		  addition to a database recording world state propositions,
		  a local closed world (LCW) database, that records
		  propositions about whose value they have complete 
		  knowledge.  They present methods for updating LCW 
		  knowledge in response to the execution of actions and
		  show that these update methods are sound and tractable,
		  although not complete.}
