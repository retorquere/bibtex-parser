    indeed an attempt to put it on more secure theoretical footing.
    Project is trying to find a path through a state-space automaton.
    Deliberation scheduling in this framework is the allocation of
    resources between \emph{policy generation} for a subgraph of the
    overall automaton and \emph{envelope expansion} to consider a
    larger subset of the state space.  Compares
    \emph{precursor-deliberation}, where you develop the whole policy
    before any execution, and \emph{recurrent-deliberation}, where the
    agent repeatedly replans.}
