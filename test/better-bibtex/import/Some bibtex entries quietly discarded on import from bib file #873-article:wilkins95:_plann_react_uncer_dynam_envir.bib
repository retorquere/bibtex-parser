  abstract =     "Agents situated in dynamic and uncertain environments
                 require several capabilities for successful operation.
                 Such agents must monitor the world and respond
                 appropriately to important events. The agents should be
                 able to accept goals, synthesize complex plans for
                 achieving those goals, and execute the plans while
                 continuing to be responsive to changes in the world. As
                 events render some current activities obsolete, the
                 agents should be able to modify their plans while
                 continuing activities unaffected by those events. The
                 CYPRESS system is a domain-independent framework for
                 defining persistent agents with this full range of
                 behavior. CYPRESS has been used for several demanding
                 applications, including military operations, real-time
                 tracking, and fault diagnosis.",
