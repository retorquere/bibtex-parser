	ANNOTE = {This article describes work on using keyhole plan
		  recognition to monitor other team members to verify
		  that the team are working together succesfully.  The
		  method is particularly of use in cases where 
		  agent-to-communications are not reliable.  An extra
		  bonus of the article is that it provides a useful hook
		  into the literature on team action and shared plans. }
