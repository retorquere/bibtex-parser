                  1974) is an approach to planning where
                  problem-specific knowledge is used to remedy the
                  computational intractability of classical
                  planning. This knowledge is in the form of task
                  decomposition directives, i.e. the planner is given
                  a set of methods that tell it how a high-level task
                  can be decomposed into lower-level tasks. The HTN
                  planning problem consists in computing a sequence of
                  primitive tasks that corresponds to performing the
                  initial set of high-level tasks. Our purpose in this
                  prthis paper is 1) to give an account of HTNplanning
                  as high-level programming in the situation calculus
                  (McCarthy 1963) based languages Golog/ConGolog
                  (Levesque et al. 1997; De Giacomo, Lesperance, \&
                  Levesque 2000) and 2) to illustrate our approach
                  with a ConGolog encoding of a logistics domain
                  HTN-planning problem. The Golog/ConGolog languages
                  have been extended to deal with explicit time,
                  sensing actions, exogenous events, execution
                  monitoring, incomplete knowledge of the initial
                  state, stochastic actions and others. Thus the range
                  of problems that can be tackled with this approach
                  is potentially much larger. As an example, we
                  modified the logistics domain encoding to execute
                  on-line and deal with run-time exogenous delivery
                  requests",
