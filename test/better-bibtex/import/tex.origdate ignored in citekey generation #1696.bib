  abstract = {We show that weak solutions of general conservation laws in bounded domains conserve their generalized entropy, and other respective companion laws, if they possess a certain fractional differentiability of order 1/3 in the interior of the domain, and if the normal component of the corresponding fluxes tend to zero as one approaches the boundary. This extends various recent results of the authors.},
