	ANNOTE = {As the name suggests, presents a sound and complete 
		  algorithm for HTN planning.  The accomplishment is less
		  overwhelming than it might at first seem, because the
		  HTN plan's semantics rests on STRIPS-style world updates.
		  So an HTN planner constructed according to this method
		  will have the same knowledge-engineering demands
		  as a first-principles STRIPS planner.}
