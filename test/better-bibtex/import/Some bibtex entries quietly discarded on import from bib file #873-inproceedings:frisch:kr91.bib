	ANNOTE = {Describes a general constraint-based approach to modal
		  logic deduction.  Essentially the approach is to perform
		  a Moore-like translation of the modal logic statements
		  into a first order representation with explicit
		  representation of the accessibility relations and 
		  existence of entities (for modal logics with different
		  domains in different possible worlds).  This representation
		  is then partititioned into a set of statements and an
		  associated set of constraints on relationships between 
		  possible worlds.  When variables are unified, the 
		  associated world constraints must be verified.
