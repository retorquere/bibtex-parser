	ANNOTE = {Cohen and Levesque critique KQML on three semantic
		  grounds:  ambiguity of specifications; 
		  misidentified performatives and performatives missing.
		  The misidentified performatives are those that operate
		  on other performatives where Cohen and Levesque argue
		  that they should be operating directly on content.
		  The major missing performative they identify is 
		  a commissive --- the agreement to perform an
		  action.  They then propose that their logic of intention
		  could be used to give a superior semantics.  They conclude
		  with some weak suggestions about the implications of this.
		  Unfortunately, their semantics seem to be too ``first
		  principles-y'' to be of much use to implementors.  
		  Finally, they say that extensibility and content
		  independence are problems.  It is hard to see how this
		  is to be remedied.}
