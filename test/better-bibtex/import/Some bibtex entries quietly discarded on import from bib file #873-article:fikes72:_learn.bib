                  of other work. Explains how \textsc{Strips} plans
                  are to be executed, stored, and reused. The key to
                  all of these techniques are the \emph{triangle
                  tables}, which are a limited form of
                  explanation-based learning. They also underly the
                  approach to execution monitoring. For the plan
                  monitoring, the triangle table contains a cached out
                  representation of the preconditions necessary for
                  execution of each plan suffix. So the executor
                  monitors the truth of each of these preconditions,
                  allowing it both to re-execute failed prefixes and
                  exploit opportunities to skip steps.}
