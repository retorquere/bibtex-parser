  abstract =	 "Planning is a central activity in many areas
                  including robotics, manufacturing, space mission
                  sequencing, and logistics. As the size and
                  complexity of planning problems grow, there is great
                  economic pressure to automate this process in order
                  to reduce the cost of planning effort, and to
                  improve the quality of produced plans. AI planning
                  research has focused on general-purpose planning
                  systems which can process the specifications of an
                  application domain and generate solutions to
                  planning problems in that domain. Unfortunately,
                  there is a big gap between theoretical and
                  application oriented work in AI planning. The
                  theoretical work has been mostly based on
                  state-based planning, which has limited practical
                  applications. The application-oriented work has been
                  based on hierarchical task network (HTN) planning,
                  which lacks a theoretical foundation. As a result,
                  in spite of many years of research, building
                  planning applications remains a formidable task. The
                  goal of this dissertation is to facilitate building
                  reliable and effective planning applications. The
                  methodology includes design of a mathematical
                  framework for HTN planning, analysis of this
                  framework, development of provably correct
                  algorithms based on this analysis, and the
                  implementation of these algorithms for further
                  evaluation and exploration. The representation,
                  analyses, and algorithms described in this thesis
                  will make it easier to apply HTN planning techniques
                  effectively and correctly to planning
                  applications. The precise and mathematical nature of
                  the descriptions will also help teaching about HTN
                  planning, will clarify misconceptions in the
                  literature, and will stimulate further research."
