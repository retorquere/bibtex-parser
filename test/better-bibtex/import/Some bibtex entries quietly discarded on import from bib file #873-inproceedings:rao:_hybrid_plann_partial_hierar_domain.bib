  annote =	 {Fits HTN planning into Rao's unifying
                  framework. Also shows how to do this in partially
                  hierarchical domains, i.e., those where some goals
                  do not have methods and use normal
                  precondition-chaining. This doesn't really arise in
                  our playbook applications, but it's very neat. Hard
                  to tell how well this works out, since there are a
                  whole bunch of fairly complex bits necessary to
                  ensure completeness and systematicity. The latter
                  could, of course, be sacrificed. Seems to subsume
                  the hierarchical planning in DPOCL and Barrent and
                  Weld, which is handy! It's always nice to be able to
                  not read a paper!},
  abstract =	 "Hierarchical task network and action-based planning
                  approaches have traditionally been studied
                  separately. In many domains, human expertise in the
                  form of hierarchical reduction schemas exists, but
                  is incomplete. In such domains, hybrid approaches
                  that use both HTN and action-based planning
                  techniques are needed. In this paper, we extend our
                  previous work on refinement planning to include
                  hierarchical planning. Specifically, we provide a
                  generalized plan-space refinement that is capable of
                  handling non-primitive actions. The generalization
                  provides a principled way of handling partially
                  hierarchical domains, while preserving
                  systematicity, and respecting the user-intent
                  inherent in the reduction schemas. Our general
                  account also puts into perspective the many surface
                  differences between the HTN and action-based
                  planners, and could support the transfer of progress
                  between HTN and action-based planning approaches.",
