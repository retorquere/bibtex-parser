  ABSTRACT =	 {The Act formalism provides a medium in which to
                  express knowledge about actions for both the SIPE-2
                  plan generation system and the PRS plan execution
                  system. This document describes the Act-Editor,
                  which provides a graphical user interface for
                  creating and manipulating Acts. The document is
                  designed for individuals who are already familiar
                  with the Act formalism. The Act-Editor runs on Sun
                  workstations with either Allegro Common Lisp 4.2/4.3
                  with CLIM 2.0/2.1, or Lucid Lisp 4.1 with CLIM 1.1.,
                  as well as Symbolics Lisp Machines.}
