	ANNOTE = {Martha Pollack's rant, based on Bratman, somewhat,
		  that plans are useful.  Contra the then-popular push
		  for reactive `planners.'  Also argues for a kind of
		  qualitative decision theory.  A la Bratman, argues that 
		  committing to intentions provides a useful control
		  of reasoning.  Discusses experiments with the IRMA
		  planning architecture.}
