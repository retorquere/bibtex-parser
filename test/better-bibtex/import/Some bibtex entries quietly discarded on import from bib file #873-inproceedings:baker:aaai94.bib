		  can behave exponentially worse than simpler approaches,
		  in particular depth-first search and backjumping.  
		  Briefly, the intuition is that in the attempt to preserve
		  work done through backtracking, dynamic backtracking 
		  often preserves constraints propagated from value choices
		  that have since been retracted, confining it in bad
		  parts of the search space.}
