	ANNOTE = {The authors review Chapman's Modal Truth Criterion (MTC)
		  from his paper ``Planning for Conjunctive Goals.''
		  They show a bug in Chapman's arguments --- in particular
		  that the equivalence $\Diamond p \equiv \neg \Box \neg p$
		  doesn't hold for truth in partially-ordered plans.
		  The reason for this is that the excluded middle does not 
		  hold in the logic of partial plans --- the truth value of
		  some $p$ in some completion of a partial plan may not be
		  defined, because the completion may be ill-formed.}
