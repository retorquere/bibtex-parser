  abstract =	"This document defines the language to be used in the
		 classical part of the 4th International Planning
		 Competition, IPC-4. The language comprises all of
		 PDDL2.1 levels 1, 2, and 3, as defined by Maria Fox and
		 Derek Long in \cite{fox:long:jair-03}; parts of this
		 document have been copied from that source. On top of
		 this language, for IPC-4 {\em derived predicates} are
		 re-introduced, and {\em timed initial literals} are
		 (newly) introduced into the competition language. We
		 give the syntax and semantics of these constructs."
