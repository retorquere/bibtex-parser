	ANNOTE = {Provides a representation of 
		  knowledge-producing actions in the situation calculus.
		  Extends Reiter's explanation-closure solution to the
		  frame problem to this extended situation calculus
		  (in which successor state axioms are automatically
		  generated from General Positive Effect and General 
		  Negative Effect axioms).
		  The authors show that knowledge-producing actions can be
		  handled using Reiter's explanation-closure approach.
		  Further, they extend Reiter's regression operators to 
		  knowledge-producing actions.  This permits one to check
		  properties of a plan (e.g., does it achieve a particular
		  goal proposition) by regressing those properties to the
		  initial situation and then doing theorem-proving
		  exclusively in that initial situation.}
