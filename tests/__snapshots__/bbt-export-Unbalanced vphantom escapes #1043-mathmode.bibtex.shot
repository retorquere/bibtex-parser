          "The results of a close-coupling calculation of the fine-structure transitions (j,mj<span class=\\"nocase\\">→</span>j<span class=\\"nocase\\">'</span>,m<span class=\\"nocase\\">'</span>j) are presented for collisions between photons and F(Pj,mj2). The theory is formulated in the perturbed-stationary-state approximation using accurate molecular wave functions for the ground II2 and <span class=\\"nocase\\">Σ</span>2 states of HF+. Comparison is made to the predictions of the Born approximation. The magnetic selection rule (j,mj<span class=\\"nocase\\">→</span>j,-mj) is strongly violated in the j=32 state and less strongly violated in the j=12 state. It is concluded that the important region of interaction for the j=12<span class=\\"nocase\\">→</span>j=32 transition is at short-to-intermediate distances where accurate molecular potentials are required and close-coupling effects are dominant.",
