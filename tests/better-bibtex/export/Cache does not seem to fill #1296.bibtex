  abstract = {Driving is a challenging task because of the physical, attentional, and emotional demands. When drivers become frustrated by events their negative emotional state can escalate dangerously. This study examines behavioral and attitudinal effects of cognitively reframing frustrating events. Participants (N = 36) were asked to navigate a challenging driving course that included frustrating events such as long lights and being cut-off. Drivers were randomly assigned to three conditions. After encountering a frustrating event, drivers in a reappraisal-down condition heard voice prompts that reappraised the event in an effort to deflate negative reactions. Drivers in the second group, reappraisal-up, heard voice prompts that brought attention to the negative actions of vehicles and pedestrians. Drivers in a silent condition drove without hearing any voice prompts. Participants in the reappraisal-down condition had better driving behavior and reported less negative emotions than participants in the other conditions.},

We then review evidence on the factors that affect the likelihood that armed conflict will occur, as well as the aspects involved when individuals make moral decisions on whether or not to support a war. Based on this review, we propose a research agenda, citing research examples from the human-computer interaction literature and discussing new ideas.},

A single-subject, time-series, control-versus-multiple-treatments design was used. Expressive and receptive learning curves for each method using regression analysis were plotted and then analysed statistically. Results suggested that the subject learned sign language vocabulary most efficiently from the teacher followed closely by the video, then the CD-ROM, and then the book. These differences were probably due to the feedback and personal contact provided only by the teacher, as well as the greater clarity of the teacher's signs as opposed to the clarity of the media.},

I point out properties of natural coverbal gestures in human communication and identify challenges for gesture comprehension systems in three areas. The first challenge is to derive the meaning of a gesture given that its semantics is defined in three semiotic dimensions that have to be addressed differently. A second challenge is the spatial composition of gestures in imagistic spaces. Finally, a third technical challenge is the development of an integrated processing model for speech and gesture.},

In this paper, a low power controller chip is designed and fabricated to manage the proposed network with low power consumption. It periodically monitors the data from maximum 255 sensor devices with less than 2-mW power consumption. The controller is implemented in 25 mm silicon area and its operation is successfully demonstrated on the test system board.},

@inproceedings{Paulos:2011fl,
  abstract = {E-waste is a generic term embracing various forms of electric and electronic equipment that is loosely discarded, surplus, obsolete, or broken. When e-waste is improperly discarded as trash, there are predictable negative impacts on the environment and human health. Existing e-waste solutions range from designing for reuse to fabricating with eco-friendly decomposable materials to more radical critiques of current practices surrounding capitalism and consumerism. Complementary to theses efforts, this paper presents an accessible reuse framework that encourages creativity while maintaining personal ownership of e-waste. Through a series of online surveys of existing personal e-waste stockpiling behaviors combined with observational studies of existing reuse practices, we developed a design reuse vocabulary: materials, shapes, and operations to enable wide ranging and creative reuse of obsolete electronics by everyday people. We operationalized this vocabulary and evaluated its legibility and usefulness. As a result, we derived a novel reuse composition framework: reuse as-is, remake, and remanufacture designed to be accessible and to have broader impact in encouraging creative reuse across a wide range of e-waste types beyond those specifically used in our study. We believe these frameworks will be a catalyst for the creative reuse of e-waste.},

This system addresses the poor match between standard computer interfaces and human spatial awareness. The desire to take advantage of these abilities was our primary motivation in developing the planar manipulator display (PMD). The PMD uses movable physical objects as a means of human-computer interaction. Our work extends research on the use of tracked physical objects as tangible input elements by providing a practical method to use \ldots{}},

  abstract = {Context-aware applications adapt to changing computing environments or changing user circumstances/tasks. Context information that supports such adaptations is provided by the underlying infrastructure, which gathers, pre-processes and provisions context information from a variety of context information sources. Such an infrastructure is prone to failures and disconnections that negatively impact on the ability of context-aware applications to adapt (and therefore dramatically impact on their usability). This paper describes a model-based autonomic context management system (ACoMS) that can dynamically configure and reconfigure its context information gathering and pre-processing functionality in order to provide fault tolerant provisioning of context information. The approach uses standards based descriptions of context information sources to increase openness, interoperability and scalability of context-aware systems.},

With simple selection and pointing hand gestures, users can eliminate cumbersome processes in managing connections and controls between multiple devices as well as in sharing information/data. We implemented a Select-and-Point system in an intelligent meeting room and performed a preliminary user study in this environment. The results show that Select-and-Point is easily accepted by users and it can significantly improve users' interaction with various devices in a ubiquitous computing environment.},

Over 92\% of Stack Overflow questions about expert topics are answered \textemdash{} in a median time of 11 minutes. Using a mixed methods approach that combines statistical data analysis with user interviews, we seek to understand this success. We argue that it is not primarily due to an a priori superior technical design, but also to the high visibility and daily involvement of the design team within the community they serve. This model of continued community leadership presents challenges to both CSCW systems research as well as to attempts to apply the Stack Overflow model to other specialized knowledge domains.},

  abstract = {This dissertation describes the motivation, design, and development of a tool for designing gestures for pen-based user interfaces. Pens and other styli have been ubiquitous for recording information for centuries. Recently, pen-based computers have recently become common, especially small devices such as the Palm Pilot. One benefit pens provide in computer interfaces is the ability to draw gestures\textemdash{}marks that invoke commands. Gestures can be intuitive and faster than other methods of invoking commands. However, our research shows that gestures are sometimes misrecognized and hard to remember. We believe these problems are due in part to the difficulty of designing good gestures\textemdash{}that is, gestures that are easy to remember and are recognized well\textemdash{}and the lack of tools for helping designers create good gestures. We believe that an improved gesture design tool can help interface designers create good gestures for their applications.},

We believe that hands-free navigation, unlike the majority of navigation tech- niques based on hand motions, has the greatest potential for max- imizing the interactivity of virtual environments since navigation modes are offloaded from modal hand gestures to more direct mo- tions of the feet and torso.},

@article{King:2007tl,
  abstract = {Robot-assisted minimally invasive surgery (MIS) offers improved range of motion over standard laparoscopic techniques, but is characterized by a total loss of haptic feedback, requiring surgeons to rely solely on visual cues. Pneumatic tactile displays have many advantages, including low mass, low cost, compact size, and adaptability. A pneumatic haptic feedback actuator array has been developed that is suitable for mounting unto surgical robotic tools. The balloon actuators consist of spin-coated thin-film silicone membranes and molded substrates with cylindrical channels. Human perceptual tests were conducted on balloon diameters ranging from 0.75 to 2.0 mm to determine the optimal size that can be effectively detected. The control system was programmed to sequentially inflate a single balloon to one of the three levels, 100\% (full hemispherical deformation), zero, 50\% (half deformation), and 0\% (no inflation). Blinded subjects (n=5) were asked to determine which of the two inflation levels was higher. Test results suggest that balloon diameters greater than 1.0 mm can deliver high detection accuracy. This indicates that pneumatic balloon-based actuation is a viable solution for generating haptic feedback. In addition to surgical applications, many other fields such as virtual reality-based simulators and neuroprosthetics can benefit from this technology.},

@inproceedings{Ariadi:2012uz,
  abstract = {This paper reports an investigation into the potential for consumers designing and manufacturing their own products using a combination of Computer Aided Consumer Design (CaCODE) and Additive Manufacturing (AM). Recent developments in the field of AM (cheaper machines and new materials) have led to renewed interest in the manufacture of customised products and, more specifically, allowing consumers to create their own bespoke products. However, a persistent weak link in this paradigm is the inability of most consumers to create 3D models as an input for AM. Operating a conventional CAD system requires a lengthy period of specialist training and is therefore not viable in this context. Consequently, easy-to-use 3D design tools are needed to make AM more accessible to consumers. This research study investigated the suitability of such a system for enabling consumers to design their own pens for manufacture using AM. The investigation also explored the consumer acceptance of current AM capabilities when used for the production of consumer products.

  abstract = {Sensors are becoming increasingly important in interaction design. Authoring a sensor-based interaction comprises three steps: choosing and connecting the appropriate hardware, creating application logic, and specifying the relationship between sensor values and application logic. Recent research has successfully addressed the first two issues. However, linking sensor input data to application logic remains an exercise in patience and trial-and-error testing for most designers. This paper introduces techniques for authoring sensor-based interactions by demonstration. A combination of direct manipulation and pattern recognition techniques enables designers to control how demonstrated examples are generalized to interaction rules. This approach emphasizes design exploration by enabling very rapid iterative demonstrate-edit-review cycles. This paper describes the manifestation of these techniques in a design tool, Exemplar, and presents evaluations through a first-use lab study and a theoretical analysis using the Cognitive Dimensions of Notation framework.},

We also posit a design that allows for handling multiple concurrent users.},

@article{Rachovides:2007p1205,
  abstract = {Computers have increasingly become part of our everyday lives, with many activities either involving their direct use or being supported by one. This has prompted research into developing methods and mechanisms to assist humans in interacting with computers (human-computer interaction, or HCI). A number of HCI techniques have been developed over the years, some of which are quite old but continue to be used, and some more recent and still evolving. Many of these interaction techniques, however, are not natural in their use and typically require the user to learn a new means of interaction. Inconsistencies within these techniques and the restrictions they impose on user creativity can also make such interaction techniques difficult to use, especially for novice users. This article proposes an alternative interaction method, the conductor interaction method (CIM), which aims to provide a more natural and easier-to-learn interaction technique. This novel interaction method extends existing HCI methods by drawing upon techniques found in human-human interaction. It is argued that the use of a two-phased multimodal interaction mechanism, using gaze for selection and gesture for manipulation, incorporated within a metaphor-based environment, can provide a viable alternative for interacting with a computer (especially for novice users). Both the model and an implementation of the CIM within a system are presented in this article. This system formed the basis of a number of user studies that have been performed to assess the effectiveness of the CIM, the findings of which are discussed in this work.},

The Cat Cat Revolution (CCR) is a digital game of cat and mouse that allows cats to participate in play through a species-appropriate interface. The game applies Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) principles to pets and casts pets as participants in the gaming experience. During the pilot study, pet owners characterized CCR as a mutually positive experience, describing the game as a fun way to play. CCR explores the effects of including pets in the digital gaming experience.},

  abstract = {Wearable computing and Augmented Reality applications call for less obtrusive and more intuitive human computer interfaces than keyboards and mice. One way to realize such interfaces is using gestures, e.g., for pointing in order to replace the mouse. The less obtrusive way of gesture recognition is to use computer vision based methods. In this paper we present a computer vision-based gesture interface that is part of an Augmented Reality system. It can recognize a 3D pointing gesture, a click gesture, and five static command gestures. An optimized lookup-table based color segmentation and a fast gesture recognition method are presented that enable for real-time performance (25Hz) on a standard PC.},

  abstract = {This paper addresses gesture recognition under small sample size, where direct use of traditional classifiers is difficult due to high dimensionality of input space. We propose a pairwise feature extraction method of video volumes for classification. The method of Canonical Correlation Analysis is combined with the discriminant functions and Scale-Invariant-Feature-Transform (SIFT) for the discriminative spatiotemporal features for robust gesture recognition. The proposed method is practically favorable as it works well with a small amount of training samples, involves few parameters, and is computationally efficient. In the experiments using 900 videos of 9 hand gesture classes, the proposed method notably outperformed the classifiers such as Support Vector Machine/Relevance Vector Machine, achieving 85\% accuracy.},

  abstract = {The mobile phone has become one of the essential objects that people carry when they leave home. By conducting a series of street interviews in 11 cities on 4 continents, we attempted to identify the main carrying options in different cultures and how these options affected user experience in interacting with the phone. We also identified several cultural differences ranging from the prevalence of cases, straps, and other physical phone modification to other ways to personalize and protect the appearance of the phone. Phone straps and decorative stickers were more prevalent in cities such as Tokyo, Seoul and Beijing but seldom witnessed in other cultures. Based on findings from this research, we identified a number of factors that affected carrying position and style, which can be summarized as ease of access vs. the need to maintain security. Non-instrumental attributes include: identity, sociability, and aesthetics. Some practical implications on interaction and industrial design are also discussed.},

  abstract = {Composition, listening, and performance are essential activities in classroom music education, yet conventional music classes impose unnecessary limitations on students' ability to develop these skills. Based on in-depth fieldwork and a user-centered design approach, we created MOGCLASS, a multimodal collaborative music environment that enhances students musical experience and improves teachers' management of the classroom.    We conducted a two-round system evaluation to improve the prototype and evaluate the system: Improvements were made based on the results from an iterative design evaluation, in which a trial system was implemented. The system then underwent a second round of evaluation through a three-week between-subject controlled experiment in a local primary school. Results showed that MOGCLASS is effective in motivating students to learn music, improving the way they collaborate with other students as well as helping teachers manage the classroom.},

  abstract = {When pointing to a target on a computer desktop, we may think we are taking the shortest possible path. But new shortcuts become possible if we allow the mouse cursor to jump from one edge of the screen to the opposite one, i.e., if we turn the desktop into a torus. We discuss the design of TorusDesktop, a pointing technique that allows to wrap the cursor around screen edges to open this pointing backdoor. A dead zone and an off-screen cursor feedback make the technique more usable and more compatible with everyday desktop usage. We report on three controlled experiments conducted to refine the design of the technique and evaluate its performance. The results suggest clear benefits of using the backdoor when target distance is more than 80\% the screen size in our experimental conditions.},

  abstract = {This paper presents the analysis of the performance of charge pump, and the design strategy and efficiency optimization of 2.4GHz micro-power charge pump using 65nm CMOS technology. The model of the charge pump takes account of the threshold voltage variation, bulk modulation, and the major parasitic capacitor. Charge pump is sensitive to the input voltage swing and the actual input voltage swing is less after the capacitor divider, which generates the optimized size transistor. From the mathematic model of the charge pump, the relationship between the charge pump performance and design parameter is presented. After parameter analysis and performance discussion, a design procedure to maximize performance is presented. Corresponding to the design procedure presented in this paper, a high efficiency charge pump at 2.4GHz is presented. View full abstract},

  abstract = {This paper describes four different systems that we have developed for capturing various manners of gesture near interactive surfaces. The first is a low-cost scanning laser rangefinder adapted to accurately track the position of bare hands in a plane just above a large projection display. The second is an acoustic system that detects the position of taps on a large, continuous surface (such as a table, wall, or window) by measuring the differential time-ofarrival of the acoustic shock impulse at several discrete locations. The third is a sensate carpet that uses a grid of piezoelectric wire to measure the dynamic location and pressure of footfalls. The fourth is a swept radio frequency (RF) tag reader that measures the height, approximate location, and other properties (orientation or a control variable like pressure) of objects containing passive, magnetically coupled resonant tags, and updates the continuous parameters of all tagged objects at 30 Hz. In addition to discussing the technologies and surveying different approaches, sample applications are given for each system.},

  abstract = {We describe the design, fabrication, and calibration of a highly compliant artificial skin sensor. The sensor consists of multilayered mircochannels in an elastomer matrix filled with a conductive liquid, capable of detecting multiaxis strains and contact pressure. A novel manufacturing method comprised of layered molding and casting processes is demonstrated to fabricate the multilayered soft sensor circuit. Silicone rubber layers with channel patterns, cast with 3-D printed molds, are bonded to create embedded microchannels, and a conductive liquid is injected into the microchannels. The channel dimensions are 200 {$\mu$}m (width) \texttimes{} 300 {$\mu$}m (height). The size of the sensor is 25 mm \texttimes{} 25 mm, and the thickness is approximately 3.5 mm. The prototype is tested with a materials tester and showed linearity in strain sensing and nonlinearity in pressure sensing. The sensor signal is repeatable in both cases. The characteristic modulus of the skin prototype is approximately 63 kPa. The sensor is functional up to strains of approximately 250\%. View full abstract},

  abstract = {\textexclamdown{}p\textquestiondown{}3D printing is a new technology in constant evolution. It has rapidly expanded and is now being used in health education. Patient-specific models with anatomical fidelity created from imaging dataset have the potential to significantly improve the knowledge and skills of a new generation of surgeons. This review outlines five technical steps required to complete a printed model: They include (1) selecting the anatomical area of interest, (2) the creation of the 3D geometry, (3) the optimisation of the file for the printing and the appropriate selection of (4) the 3D printer and (5) materials. All of these steps require time, expertise and money. A thorough understanding of educational needs is therefore essential in order to optimise educational value. At present, most of the available printing materials are rigid and therefore not optimum for flexibility and elasticity unlike biological tissue. We believe that the manipuation and tuning of material properties through the creation of composites and/or blending materials will eventually allow for the creation of patient-specific models which have both anatomical and tissue fidelity.\textexclamdown/p\textquestiondown{}},

  abstract = {One of the main problems in dynamic time-warping (DTW) based speech recognition systems are the preparation of reliable reference templates for the set of words to be recognised. This paper presents a simple novel technique for preparing reliable reference templates to improve the recognition rate score. The developed technique produces templates called crosswords reference templates (CWRTs). It extracts the reference template from a set of examples rather than one example. This technique can be adapted to any DTW-based speech recognition systems to improve its performance. The speaker-dependent recognition rate, as tested on the English digits, is improved from 85.3\%, using the traditional technique to 99\%, using the developed technique.},

These sensors permit devices to recognize motion gestures\textemdash{}deliberate movements of the device by end-users to invoke commands. However, little is known about best-practices in motion gesture design for the mobile computing paradigm. To address this issue, we present the results of a guessability study that elicits end-user motion gestures to invoke commands on a smartphone device. We demonstrate that consensus exists among our participants on parameters of movement and on mappings of motion gestures onto commands. We use this consensus to develop a taxonomy for motion gestures and to specify an end-user inspired motion gesture set. We highlight the implications of this work to the design of smartphone applications and hardware. Finally, we argue that our results influence best practices in design for all gestural interfaces.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we describe our investigation into user tolerance of recognition errors during hand gesture interactions with visual displays. The study is based on our proposed interaction model for investigating gesture based interactions, focusing on three elements: Interaction context, system performance and user goals. This Wizard of Oz experiment investigates how recognition system accuracy rates and task characteristics in both desktop and ubiquitous computing scenarios can influence user tolerance for gesture interactions. Results suggest that interaction context is a greater influence on user tolerance than system performance alone, where recognition error rates can potentially reach 40\% before users will abandon gestures and use an alternate interaction mode in a ubiquitous computing scenario. Results also suggest that in a desktop scenario, traditional input methods are more appropriate than gestures.},

  abstract = {We introduce a novel system for recognizing patterns of eye blinks for use in assistive technology interfaces and security systems. First, we present a blink-based interface for controlling devices. Well known songs are used as the cadence for the blinked patterns. Our system distinguishes between ten similar patterns with 99.0\% accuracy. Second, we present a method for identifying individual people based on the characteristics of how they perform a specific pattern (their blinkprint). This technique could be used in conjunction with face recognition for security systems. We are able to distinguish between nine individuals with 82.02\% accuracy based solely on how they blink the same pattern.},

  abstract = {This paper describes the development of a musical interface based on electromagnetic tagging technology, where an ensemble of passively tagged objects is identified and tracked in real time when placed in the vicinity of a reader. As the system is able to identify and update the state of many (30 or more) tags simultaneously, they can be used together in any combination - e.g., several can sit on a surface at fixed distances from the reader while others can be handheld or worn by a single user or multiple performers. This interface is able to detect both free gesture (position and orientation of the objects) as well as local or tactile variables (e.g., pressure). We describe a series of controllers that exploit the musical possibilities of this architecture - the somewhat constrained Musical Trinkets , where objects were tied to simple notes and musical effects, and its successor, the Musical Navigatrics , which enabled dynamic overdubbing and control of complex musical sequences and sonic textures. We close with a description of a very simple and inexpensive actively tagged tracking system capable of much wider range.},

@article{Siddiqui:2006p1255,
  abstract = {We describe an efficient and robust system to detect and track the limbs of a human. Of special consideration in the design of this system are real-time and robustness issues. We thus utilize a detection/tracking scheme in which we detect the face and limbs of a user and then track the forearms of the found limbs. Detection occurs by first finding the face of a user. The location and color information from the face can then be used to find limbs. As skin color is a key visual feature in this system, we continuously search for faces and use them to update skin color information. Along with edge information, this is used in the subsequent forearm tracking. Robustness is implicit in this design, as the system automatically re-detects a limbs when its corresponding forearms is lost. This design is also conducive to real-time processing because while detection of the limbs can take up to seconds, tracking is on the order of milliseconds. Thus reasonable frame rates can be achieved with a short latency. Also, in this system we make use of multiple 2D limb tracking models to enhance tracking of the underlying 3D structure. This includes models for lateral forearm views (waving) as well as for pointing gestures. Experiments on test sequences demonstrate the efficacy of this approach.},

  abstract = {This paper introduces a finger-ring shaped wearable HANDset. It uses the human finger as a transmission route for the receiving voice (bone conduction). Vibration noise is reduced using a newly-created microphone unit named "Duaphragm" that can suppress echo by about 70\%. Duaphragm provides a small, low-power, and low-cost means of reducing vibration noise. In addition, a new LSI chip that integrates an accelerometer and a tapping command detector allows the handset to be controlled by tapping the fingertip on which the device is worn. Keywords: interface device, headset, noise cancel.},

In this paper we introduce Adaptive RSVP, describe the design of a prototype on a mobile device, and report findings from a usability evaluation where the ability to read long and short texts was assessed. In a latin-square balanced repeated-measurement experiment, employing 16 subjects, two variants of Adaptive RSVP were benchmarked against Fixed RSVP and traditional text presentation. For short texts, all RSVP formats increased reading speed by 33\% with no significant differences in comprehension or task load. For long texts, no differences were found in reading speed or comprehension, but all RSVP formats increased task load significantly. Nevertheless, Adaptive RSVP decreased task load ratings for most factors compared to Fixed RSVP. Causes, implications, and effects of these findings are discussed.},

  abstract = {Despite the prevalence of affordable maker tools such as 3D printers and laser cutters, actually creating digital models remains out of the reach of most everyday users. Even when users are able to design or fabricate items, some everyday users may be more interested in modifying or replacing objects that they already own rather than inventing new items. Addressing the needs of these users requires taking a different approach than that taken by most computer-aided design tools. To address this need, we introduce the notion of design from imperfect examples, in which existing objects are scanned and modified to create new objects. We present examples of this design approach and describe the development and formative evaluation of the Easy Make Oven, a prototyping tool that enables novice users to create simple 3D designs based on their existing possessions.},

  abstract = {This paper presents a low-power wideband signaling (WBS) digital transceiver for data transmission through a human body for body area network applications. The low-power and highspeed human body communication (HBC) utilizes a digital transceiver chip based on WBS and adopts a direct-coupled interface (DCI) which uses an electrode of 50-Omega impedance. The channel investigation with the DCI identities an optimum channel bandwidth of 10 kHz to 100 MHz. The WBS digital transceiver exploits a direct digital transmitter and an all-digital clock and data recovery (CDR) circuit. To further reduce power consumption, the proposed CDR circuit incorporates a low-voltage digitally-controlled oscillator and a quadratic sampling technique. The WBS digital transceiver chip with a 0.25-mum standard CMOS technology has 2-Mb/s data rate at a bit error rate of 1.1 times 10-7, dissipating only 0.2 mW from a 1-V supply generated by a 1.5-V battery.},

  abstract = {Sketching User Experiences approaches design and design thinking as something distinct that needs to be better understood-by both designers and the people with whom they need to work- in order to achieve success with new products and systems. So while the focus is on design, the approach is holistic. Hence, the book speaks to designers, usability specialists, the HCI community, product managers, and business executives. There is an emphasis on balancing the back-end concern with usability and engineering excellence (getting the design right) with an up-front investment in sketching and ideation (getting the right design). Overall, the objective is to build the notion of informed design: molding emerging technology into a form that serves our society and reflects its values. Grounded in both practice and scientific research, Bill Buxton{\"A}{\^o}s engaging work aims to spark the imagination while encouraging the use of new techniques, breathing new life into user experience design. Covers sketching and early prototyping design methods suitable for dynamic product capabilities: cell phones that communicate with each other and other embedded systems, "smart" appliances, and things you only imagine in your dreams Thorough coverage of the design sketching method which helps easily build experience prototypes-without the effort of engineering prototypes which are difficult to abandon Reaches out to a range of designers, including user interface designers, industrial designers, software engineers, usability engineers, product managers, and others Full of case studies, examples, exercises, and projects, and access to video clips that demonstrate the principles and methods},

Whereas there are different methods and commercial products available, they all have a common drawback: the user has to mount some piece of sensor to his body. This paper provides a case study on how micro-impulse radar (MIR) can be used to sense heart-rate in a contact-free manner. With a sequence of tests the robustness of radar to different placements and even distances from the subject is shown. Since MIR is also cheap and power-efficient this paper suggests heart-rate sensing through radar as a promising approach.},

@article{Keogh:2005p27,
  abstract = {The problem of indexing time series has attracted much research interest in the database community. Most algorithms used to index time series utilize the Euclidean distance or some variation thereof. However is has been forcefully shown that the Euclidean distance is a very brittle distance measure. Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) is a much more robust distance measure for time series, allowing similar shapes to match even if they are out of phase in the time axis. Because of this flexibility, DTW is widely used in science, medicine, industry and finance. Unfortunately however, DTW does not obey the triangular inequality, and thus has resisted attempts at exact indexing. Instead, many researchers have introduced approximate indexing techniques, or abandoned the idea of indexing and concentrated on speeding up sequential search. In this work we introduce a novel technique for the exact indexing of DTW. We prove that our method guarantees no false dismissals and we demonstrate its vast superiority over all competing approaches in the largest and most comprehensive set of time series indexing experiments ever undertaken.},

@article{Bach:2008p1198,
  abstract = {Car drivers are nowadays offered a wide array of in-vehicle systems i.e. route guidance systems, climate controls, music players. Such in-vehicle systems often require the driver's visual attention, but visual workload has shown significant less eyes-on-the-road time and affects driving performance. In this paper, we illustrate and compare three different interaction techniques for in-vehicle systems. We refer to them as tactile, touch, and gesture interaction. The focus of the techniques is the effects on drivers while driving cars. We evaluated the interaction techniques with 16 subjects in two settings. Our results showed that gesture interaction has a significant effect on the number of driver eye glances especially eye fixations of more seconds. However, gesture interaction still required rapid eye glances for hand/eye coordination. On the other hand, touch interaction leads to fast and efficient task completion while tactile interaction seemed inferior to the two other interaction techniques.},

We extend this research by 1) investigating the problems that readers experience in their real world tasks, 2) inquiring about their requirements for an ideal reading technology, and 3) updating earlier studies of naturalistic reading behavior, which are several years old now. We present here the results of our investigation, which included a diary study, interviews, and participatory design workshops.},

Dey discuss the predictions of Mark Weiser, the father of ubiquitous computing, who envisioned that we would have smart personal environments, with numerous computational devices embedded within each environment. The authors point out that, rather than this happening, what we have currently are personalized computational devices, for example, smart phones, tied to users rather than embedded in the environment. The interesting development of this observation is the crux of their article. Even though multimedia, per se, is not specifically addressed in the article, what the authors have to say is certainly relevant to our community, as smart computational devices and sensors of various sorts are certainly siblings under the skin.-William I.

However, recent advances in sensor technologies require resource-efficient algorithms that can be implemented directly on the sensors as real-time algorithms. We show how a recently introduced framework for time series classification, time series bitmaps, can be implemented as efficient classifiers which can be updated in constant time and space in the face of very high data arrival rates. We describe results from a case study of an important entomological problem, and further demonstrate the generality of our ideas with an example from robotics.},

@article{Keogh:2001p3237,
  abstract = {Similarity search in large time series databases has attracted much research interest recently. It is a difficult problem because of the typically high dimensionality of the data.. The most promising solutions involve performing dimensionality reduction on the data, then indexing the reduced data with a multidimensional index structure. Many dimensionality reduction techniques have been proposed, including Singular Value Decomposition (SVD), the Discrete Fourier transform (DFT), and the Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT). In this work we introduce a new dimensionality reduction technique which we call Adaptive Piecewise Constant Approximation (APCA). While previous techniques (e.g., SVD, DFT and DWT) choose a common representation for all the items in the database that minimizes the global reconstruction error, APCA approximates each time series by a set of constant value segments of varying lengths such that their individual reconstruction errors are minimal. We show how APCA can be indexed using a multidimensional index structure. We propose two distance measures in the indexed space that exploit the high fidelity of APCA for fast searching: a lower bounding Euclidean distance approximation, and a non-lower bounding, but very tight Euclidean distance approximation and show how they can support fast exact searching, and even faster approximate searching on the same index structure. We theoretically and empirically compare APCA to all the other techniques and demonstrate its superiority.},

@article{Zuniga:2015ig,
  abstract = {There is an increasing number of children with traumatic and congenital hand amputations or reductions. Children's prosthetic needs are complex due to their small size, constant growth, and psychosocial development. Families financial resources play a crucial role in the prescription of prostheses for their children, especially when private insurance and public funding are insufficient. Electric-powered (i.e., myoelectric) and body-powered (i.e., mechanical) devices have been developed to accommodate childrens needs, but the cost of maintenance and replacement represents an obstacle for many families. Due to the complexity and high cost of these prosthetic hands, they are not accessible to children from low-income, uninsured families or to children from developing countries. Advancements in computer-aided design (CAD) programs, additive manufacturing, and image editing software offer the possibility of designing, printing, and fitting prosthetic hands devices at a distance and at very low cost. The purpose of this preliminary investigation was to describe a low-cost three-dimensional (3D)-printed prosthetic hand for children with upper-limb reductions and to propose a prosthesis fitting methodology that can be performed at a distance.},

In addition to manipulating ringer volume, vibration, and phone alerts, SenSay can provide remote callers with the ability to communicate the urgency of their calls, make call suggestions to users when they are idle, and provide the caller with feedback on the current status of the SenSay user. A number of sensors including accelerometers, light, and microphones are mounted at various points on the body to provide data about the users context. A decision module uses a set of rules to analyze the sensor data and manage a state machine composed of uninterruptible, idle, active and normal states. Results from our threshold analyses show a clear delineation can be made among several user states by examining sensor data trends. SenSay augments its contextual knowledge by tapping into applications such as electronic calendars, address books, and task lists.},

  abstract = {Video games are primarily designed for the players. However, video game spectating is also a popular activity, boosted by the rise of online video sites and major gaming tournaments. In this paper, we focus on the spectator, who is emerging as an important stakeholder in video games. Our study focuses on Starcraft, a popular real-time strategy game with millions of spectators and high level tournament play. We have collected over a hundred stories of the Starcraft spectator from online sources, aiming for as diverse a group as possible. We make three contributions using this data: i) we find nine personas in the data that tell us who the spectators are and why they spectate; ii) we strive to understand how different stakeholders, like commentators, players, crowds, and game designers, affect the spectator experience; and iii) we infer from the spectators' expressions what makes the game entertaining to watch, forming a theory of distinct types of information asymmetry that create suspense for the spectator. One design implication derived from these findings is that, rather than presenting as much information to the spectator as possible, it is more important for the stakeholders to be able to decide how and when they uncover that information.},

  abstract = {Folk music forms in India are rich and diverse, varying from region to region across the Indian landscape. The recent explosion of new media technologies (e.g. DVDs, CDs, mobile phones) in both rural and urban India is changing how oral folk music is being performed, produced, distributed, and shared. To further understand this impact, we conducted an extended field study across four field sites in India that are rich in folk music tradition and activity. Through a process of interviews, participant observation, focus group discussion, and content analysis with a varied group of stakeholders \textendash{} including folk musicians, listeners, retailers, and radio show producers \textendash{} we found that 1) there are a diverse set of motivations for performing and listening to folk music, 2) new media technologies are helping folk musicians become more popular, while reducing some streams of revenue, particularly for businesses engaged only in music production and distribution, and 3) as expected, piracy is widely tolerated by musicians, both out of apathy, and an interest in reaching new audiences with their message, while increasing their own fame and associated patronage. Based on these findings, we propose some implications for the design of an appropriate folk music sharing and distribution service that addresses these various motivations of the musicians and listeners.},

  abstract = {This paper presents a newly developed shortrange, ultra-low power wireless device called the i-Bean, an ad hoc, self-organizing network protocol, and their application to ambulatory bioinstrumentation using a novel finger photoplethymo-graphic sensor called the Ring Sensor. The i-Bean is made of commercial, off-the-shelf components, and functions as an integrated RF transceiver as well as data acquisition and processing device. The innovative design of the i-Bean circuitry results in extremely low power consumption for the device to run on a compact battery for exceptional long periods. A proprietary protocol allows multiple i-Beans to form ad hoc, self-organizing networks with optimal power efficiency. The Ring Sensor can measure arterial blood volume waveforms and blood oxygen saturation non-invasively and unobtrusively from the wearers finger base. Combing the i-Bean and the Ring Sensor, a fully self-contained, wearable instrument has been developed ideal for on-line, long-term and continuous monitoring of vital signs.},

  abstract = {This paper presents TinyMotion, a pure software approach for detecting a mobile phone user's hand movement in real time by analyzing image sequences captured by the built-in camera. We present the design and implementation of TinyMotion and several interactive applications based on TinyMotion. Through both an informal evaluation and a formal 17-participant user study, we found that 1. TinyMotion can detect camera movement reliably under most background and illumination conditions. 2. Target acquisition tasks based on TinyMotion follow Fitts' law and Fitts law parameters can be used for TinyMotion based pointing performance measurement. 3. The users can use Vision TiltText, a TinyMotion enabled input method, to enter sentences faster than MultiTap with a few minutes of practicing. 4. Using camera phone as a handwriting capture device and performing large vocabulary, multilingual real time handwriting recognition on the cell phone are feasible. 5. TinyMotion based gaming is enjoyable and immediately available for the current generation camera phones. We also report user experiences and problems with TinyMotion based interaction as resources for future design and development of mobile interfaces.},

However, as we move towards a world where interaction is based on human body movements that are not well documented or studied, we face a serious and a grave risk of creating technology and systems that may lead to musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs). Designers need to be empowered with objective data on the impact of multitouch interactions on the musculoskeletal system to make informed choices in interaction design. In this paper we present an experiment that documents kinematic (movement) and kinetic measures (EMG) when interacting with a multitouch tablet. Results show that multitouch interaction can induce significant stress that may lead to MSDs and care must be taken when designing multitouch interaction.},

Based on the dual linked-list structure, it can add or remove the nodes in the network during operation within 8{$\mu$}s and 500ms, respectively. To achieve low power consumption, three schemes of clock gating, low duty-cycled operation, and fixed-order allocation are proposed. As a result, the proposed network controller consumes only 2.1{$\mu$}W in average with 20MHz clock. View full abstract},

  abstract = {In the development of gestural interfaces for product design, the perceptual-motor skills of the designer and the expressive, creative process of design need to be supported. To accomplish this goal, we propose a different approach than currently used in research on gestures. We propose that meaning is central to the definition of ?gesture? and discuss a new categorisation for gestures in which gestures refer (simultaneously) to four aspects, namely space, pathic information, symbols and emotion. This definition and categorisation also ask for a different type of experimentation. We show with two experiments how gestural human-computer interaction for product design can be studied. By having a trained artist mimic a gestural interface for design, we found that an accurate interpretation of the created product can be made, even when designers are allowed full freedom in their gestures. We find that task-specific intuitive human-computer interaction using gestures is feasible, although extensive research is necessary and ongoing},

The system uses Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) to recognize multimodal sequences of different lengths, embedded in continuous data streams. We evaluate the performance of our system on two real world datasets: 1) accelerometer data acquired from performing two hand gestures and 2) NOKIA's benchmark dataset for context recognition. The results from both datasets demonstrate that the system can perform online context recognition efficiently and achieve high recognition accuracy.},

I present a testbed for this framework in the form of a program that generates speech, gesture, and facial expression from underlying rules specifying (a) what speech and gesture are generated on the basis of a given communicative intent, (b) how communicative intent is distributed across communicative modalities, and (c) where one can expect to find gestures with respect to the other communicative acts. Finally, I describe a system that has the capacity to interpret communicative facial, gestural, intonational, and verbal behaviors.},

This solution has many advantages over traditional home automation interfaces in that it can be used by those with loss of vision, motor skills, and mobility. By combining other sources of context with the pendant we can reduce the number and complexity of gestures while maintaining functionality. As users input gestures, the system can also analyze their movements for pathological tremors. This information can then be used for medical diagnosis, therapy, and emergency services. Currently, the Gesture Pendant can recognize control gestures with an accuracy of 95\% and user-defined gestures with an accuracy of 97\%. It can detect tremors above 2 HZ within /spl plusmn/.1 Hz.

  abstract = {The rapid development of handheld devices is driving the development of new interaction styles. This paper examines one such technique: using hand motions to control a menu system. Previous research on this topic deals with systems which rely heavily on graphical feedback, a disadvantage in many mobile scenarios. Inspired by marking menus, our system is designed to be used "eyes-free" and based on making relatively large scale rotational strokes. We describe the system and an initial evaluation in detail. The results indicate that its performance is comparable to previous motion menu systems, but that this can be attained without visual feedback. This represents a substantial benefit.},

In our research, we investigate new interaction techniques that aim to make it easier to interact with these systems while driving. We suggest utilizing the steering wheel as an additional interaction surface. In this paper, we present two user studies conducted with a working prototype of a multi-touch steering wheel. In the first, we developed a user-defined steering wheel gesture set, and in the second, we applied the identified gestures and compared their application to conventional user interaction with infotainment systems in terms of driver distraction. The main outcome was that driver's visual demand is reduced significantly by using gestural interaction on the multi-touch steering wheel.},

  abstract = {Non-planar screens, such as columns, have been a popular means for displaying information for a long time. In contrast to traditional displays their digital counterparts are mainly flat and rectangular due to current technological constraints. However, we envision bendable displays to be available in the future, which will allow for creating new forms of displays with new properties. In this paper we explore cylindrical displays as a possible form of such novel public displays. We present a prototype and report on a user study, comparing the influence of the display shape on user behavior and user experience between flat and cylindrical displays. The results indicate that people move more in the vicinity of cylindrical displays and that there is no longer a default position when it comes to interaction. As a result, such displays are especially suitable to keep people in motion and to support gesture-like interaction.},

The system features a force-based layout that allows to explore spatial organizations, and hence to gain new insights. Its main advantage over existing software, is that it empowers the students to create different views of their digital collection. A view is a spatial organization of a selection of the collection content and its relations. It can e.g. be used for a specific design activity or project phase, for organizing work around a specific topic, or for explaining the perspective of a given student or stakeholder. Feedback of design students working with Freed during their design projects, and results from a workshop as measured by a questionnaire, show positive prospects for adoption of the system during the design process.},

@inproceedings{SahamiShirazi:2011bv,
  abstract = {Even with the rise of the World Wide Web, TV has remained  the most pervasive entertainment medium and is  nowadays often used together with other media, which allow  for active participation. The idea of connecting non-collocated  TV viewers via telecommunication technologies,  referred to as Social TV, has recently received considerable  attention. Such systems typically include set-top boxes for  supporting collaboration. In this research we investigate if  real-time opinion sharing about TV shows through a nonverbal  (non-textual) iconic UI on mobile phones is reasonable.  For this purpose we developed a mobile app, made it  available to a large number of users through the Android  Market, and conducted an uncontrolled user study in the  wild during the soccer world cup 2010. The results of the  study indicate that TV viewers who used the app had more  fun and felt more connected to other viewers. We also show  that by monitoring this channel it is possible to collect sentiments  relevant to the broadcasted content in real-time. The  collected data exemplify that the aggregated sentiments  correspond to important moments, and hence can be used to  generate a summary of the event.},

  abstract = {Mobile communication devices, such as mobile phones and networked personal digital assistants (PDAs), allow users to be constantly connected and communicate anywhere and at any time, often resulting in personal and private communication taking place in public spaces. This private \textendash{} public contrast can be problematic. As a remedy, we promote intimate interfaces: interfaces that allow subtle and minimal mobile interaction, without disruption of the surrounding environment. In particular, motionless gestures sensed through the electromyographic (EMG) signal have been proposed as a solution to allow subtle input in a mobile context. In this paper we present an expansion of the work on EMG-based motionless gestures including (1) a novel study of their usability in a mobile context for controlling a realistic, multimodal interface and (2) a formal assessment of how noticeable they are to informed observers. Experimental results confirm that subtle gestures can be profitably used within a multimodal interface and that it is difficult for observers to guess when someone is performing a gesture, confirming the hypothesis of subtlety.},

Our approach detects several types of edges, and makes use of both 3D shape information and photometric texture information. Edges are categorized as occluding edges, occluded edges, boundary edges, high-curvature edges, and RGB edges. We exploit the organized structure of the RGB-D image to efficiently detect edges, enabling near real-time performance. We present two applications of these edge features: edge-based pair-wise registration and a pose-graph SLAM approach based on this registration, which we compare to state-of-the-art methods. Experimental results demonstrate the performance of edge detection and edge-based registration both quantitatively and qualitatively. View full abstract},

@article{Savidis:2002p7712,
  abstract = {The concept of ubiquitous computing reflects an infrastructure in which users are engaged in mobile interaction sessions within environments composed of dynamically varying computational resources. In this paradigm, applications are required to continuously follow end users and provide high-quality interaction while migrating among different computing devices and dynamically utilizing the available input/output (I/O) resources of each device. In the context of such interaction scenarios, the principle of continuity, which emphasizes the uninterrupted sequence of dialogue activities, is put forward as a key design goal. This paper presents an application experiment demonstrating interface migration, distributed I/O control, and dynamic I/O reconfiguration. The adopted dialogue design approach is discussed, along with the identified interaction design requirements, from the perspective of dialogue continuity. Finally, the employed software engineering strategy is presented, elaborating on the way dialogue mobility, distribution, and dynamic I/O control have been accomplished.},

@book{Wu:2009p6185,
  abstract = {Gesture-based interaction, as a natural way for human-computer interaction, has a wide range of applications in ubiquitous computing environment. This paper presents an acceleration-based gesture recognition approach, called FDSVM (Frame-based Descriptor and multi-class SVM), which needs only a wearable 3-dimensional accelerometer. With FDSVM, firstly, the acceleration data of a gesture is collected and represented by a frame-based descriptor, to extract the discriminative information. Then a SVM-based multi-class gesture classifier is built for recognition in the nonlinear gesture feature space. Extensive experimental results on a data set with 3360 gesture samples of 12 gestures over weeks demonstrate that the proposed FDSVM approach significantly outperforms other four methods: DTW, Nave Bayes, C4.5 and HMM. In the user-dependent case, FDSVM achieves the recognition rate of 99.38\% for the 4 direction gestures and 95.21\% for all the 12 gestures. In the user-independent case, it obtains the recognition rate of 98.93\% for 4 gestures and 89.29\% for 12 gestures. Compared to other accelerometer-based gesture recognition approaches reported in literature FDSVM gives the best resulrs for both user-dependent and user-independent cases.},

@article{Anonymous:2011fx,
  abstract = {Readers on the Web often skim through text to cope with the volume of available information. In a previous study, Duggan and Payne [11] tracked readers eye movements as they skimmed through expository text under time pressure. This article presents novel analyses of these eye-movement data. Results indicated that readers were able to explicitly direct attention to the most important information in the text and that this improved performance on a subsequent test of memory for the meaning of text. We suggest readers achieve this by satisficing \textendash{} reading through text until the rate of information gain drops below threshold and then skipping to the next section of text. Further analyses of gaze patterns for paragraphs and pages supported this explanation. Combining satisficing with some form of scanning or sampling behaviour could explain patterns of reading found on the Web. A greater understanding of the way that text is read on the Web would assist many producers of online content.},

We remedy this by extending a previous design and mimicking dialog boxes to provide good visual feedback while still keeping the advantages of keyboard input. A laboratory study showed the new technique to be competitive with dialog boxes on speed and error rate, but strongly preferred over dialog boxes by experienced command line users. This is a marked improvement over the previous design, which was also preferred by the target user group but did not compete with dialog boxes in terms of performance.},

Through focus group discussions with 40 primary and secondary pupils in special schools, we sought to learn about their perspectives on the design and use of tactile graphics. The findings emphasise the challenges involved, not only for the users themselves, but also for their teachers and for specialist designers of tactile graphics.},

  abstract = {A proliferation of mobile devices in everyday life has increased the likelihood of technologically mediated interruptions. We examine ethnographic data from an SMSbased pervasive game in order to explicate the situated character of interruption. Ethnomethodological analysis of gameplay in the context of participants everyday lives shows that interruption handling is shaped by its accountability to the various people or cohorts whose concerns participants need to juggle simultaneously. Findings inform existing approaches to design where certain presuppositions regarding the nature of interruption prevail. Accordingly, we propose an approach to interruption handling that respects the ways in which people orient to and reason about interruptions locally in the conduct of situated action.},

@article{Dementyev:2013ey,
  abstract = {This paper is intended to guide developers of wireless systems who are puzzled by the vast number of radio configuration parameters and options. We provide experimental data comparing power consumption of Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), ZigBee and ANT protocols for a cyclic sleep scenario, in which a short-range and low-power wireless sensor node periodically sends a data packet to a remote `hub' with intervening sleep intervals. Devices such as wearable health monitors often use this scenario when interfacing with a mobile phone-based hub. For all measured sleep intervals BLE achieved lower power consumption (10.1 uA, 3.3 V supply at 120 s interval), compared with ZigBee (15.7 uA), and ANT (28.2 uA). Most of the power consumption differences can be attributed to the time taken for a node to connect to the hub after waking up and the use of sleep between individual RF packets. For the three protocols we determined a sleep interval at which the tradeoff between power consumption and data rate is optimized. View full abstract},

@article{Sasaki:2009p7397,
  abstract = {We have investigated the basic principles of intrabody communication with a newly developed ridge-type electrooptic (EO) sensor. To intuitively understand the essence of intrabody communication, we introduced a simple model based on the fact that human body can approximately be considered as a conductor wrapped in an insulator. To demonstrate the propriety of the model, we measured the characteristics of communication systems including a human body using the EO sensor. The experimental results well agree with the predictions from the model. The new ridge-type EO sensor is shown to be superior to our previous EO sensor, both in sensitivity and in stability. With the ridge-type EO sensor, we succeeded in 10-Mb/s data transmission through the human body. Furthermore, we discussed the advantages of using the EO sensor for intrabody communication.},

@article{Martin:2002p7388,
  abstract = {The watch long ago encountered many of the major issues confronting wearable computing today. This paper examines the parallels in the development of the watch and the wearable computer. It discusses how the locations where the watch was worn on the body have changed over time, examines a variety of user interfaces for watches, and looks at how the watch affected cultural concepts of time and time discipline. The lessons for wearable computing are that the physical wearability will be determined as much by fashion as by human anatomy, that the user interface will gradually become simplified as people become more acquainted with computers, and finally that the cultural impact will be a broadening of the definition of information, a rationalization of representing information, and an increasing synchronization of personal events.},

In this paper, we focus on the problem of developing and maintaining a physical model of the environment using a mobile computer. We describe a set of tools for automatically creating and modifying three-dimensional contextual information. The tools can be utilized across multiple hardware platforms, with different capabilities, and operating in collaboration with one another. We demonstrate the capabilities of the tools using two mobile platforms. One of them, a mobile augmented reality system is used to construct a geometric model of an indoor environment which is then visualized on the same platform},

@article{Yao:1986p10515,
  abstract = {In this paper we introduce a new tool for controlling the knowledge transfer process in cryptographic protocol design. It is applied to solve a general class of problems which include most of the two-party cryptographic problems in the literature. Specifically, we show how two parties A and B can interactively generate a random integer N = p{\^A}\textquestiondown{}q such that its secret, i.e., the prime factors (p, q), is hidden from either party individually but is recoverable jointly if desired. This can be utilized to give a protocol for two parties with private values i and j to compute any polynomially computable functions f(i,j) and g(i,j) with minimal knowledge transfer and a strong fairness property. As a special case, A and B can exchange a pair of secrets sA, sB, e.g. the factorization of an integer and a Hamiltonian circuit in a graph, in such a way that sA becomes computable by B when and only when sB becomes computable by A. All these results are proved assuming only that the problem of factoring large intergers is computationally intractable.},

@article{Knight:2005dda,
  abstract = {Wearable computer comfort can be affected by numerous factors, making its assessment based on one value with one scale inappropriate. This paper presents a tool that measures wearable comfort across six dimensions: emotion, attachment, harm, perceived change, movement, and anxiety. The dimensions for these comfort rating scales were specifically developed for wearable equipment assessment by applying multidimensional scaling to a comfort term association matrix developed using the results of groupings of wearable computer comfort terms. Testing the scales on four different types of wearable computer showed that the scales can be used to highlight differences in comfort between different types of technology for different aspects of comfort. An intraclass correlation of .872 suggested that the scales were used with a high level of reliability. A second study showed that modifications made to a wearable computer resulted in improvements in comfort, although they were not significant (p \textquestiondown{} .05). A potential application for this research is as an aid to designers and researchers for assessing the wearability, in terms of comfort, of wearable computer devices and to determine the effectiveness of any modifications made to the design of a wearable device.},

  abstract = {Intra-body communication is a wireless means of exchanging information within a personal area network (PAN) between wearable electronic sensors and devices. The feasibility of intra-body communication is confirmed through several experiments on signal propagation within the human body, and a human phantom is designed and used to obtain reproducible results over repeated experiments. Based on the results of these experiments, a prototype transmission system is constructed using aluminum electrodes powered by 3 V DC and operating in the 10.7 MHz frequency modulation (FM) band. This prototype is demonstrated to be capable of transmitting analog signals through the human subjects in the presence of external noise. Digital data transmission at 9600 bps is also achieved using newly fabricated 10.7 MHz frequency shift keying (FSK) transmitter and receiver devices. The carrier frequency of 10.7 MHz is the intermediate frequency of FM radio receivers, meaning that the proposed system can make use of a wide selection of inexpensive, commercial radio frequency devices.},

In this paper, we describe the evolution of the DJammer including the interactive process and evaluation which led to the latest prototype. This latest prototype allows its users to "touch" their digital music through single-handed manipulation and control. By allowing both creativity and communication with digital music, the DJammer is a new musical instrument which takes the next step in the evolution of portable music players.},

  abstract = {Fitts empirical result is stated and its information theoretic interpretation briefly discussed. An alternate derivation from a model assuming continuous velocity control of hand position is shown to fit the motion time data equally well. Detailed studies of hand motion trajectories in Fitts reciprocal tapping task have confirmed the exponential target approach predicted by this model but also revealed systematic fluctuations that it cannot explain. A further alternate model is therefore presented, based on intermittent feedback with target approach by a sequence of discrete positional corrective motion impulses. T h e second model also predicts motion times in accord with Fitts Law.},

@inproceedings{Underwood:2014we,
  abstract = {has long been established as a crucial part of the Product Design process. In recent years Rapid Prototyping (RP) has played an increasingly important role in this area, within industry and education. But exactly how RP fits within a modern Product Design curriculum, and the extent to which it is utilised, are contentious issues. While some Universities are happy to make use of RP throughout the design process, to date Bournemouth University (BU) has favoured traditional model making skills during the concept testing stage. However, while traditional methods may present a number of advantages over RP \textendash{} such as more direct scalar and tactile feedback, and a broader understanding of materials \textendash{} they may also have a detrimental effect on students designs. The limitations of producing an accurate model by hand may well be responsible for restricting design development, while the use of new technology may instead encourage a wider range of possibilities. This paper seeks to explore the influence of RP and traditional workshop skills during the concept modelling phase of Product Design. Through the use of a comparative study involving design iterations with different modelling methods, the early design process is examined with particular focus on the experiences of the students themselves. The results highlight the benefits and drawbacks of using RP during concept testing and how new technology can influence student behaviour at this crucial stage of design development.},

Analysis of 912 video clips of gesture production from a user study of 16 subjects communicating transitive actions (manipulation of objects with or without external tools) indicated that 1) dynamic pantomimic gestures where imagined tool/object is explicitly held are performed more intuitively and easily than gestures where a body part is used to represent the tool/object or compared to static hand poses and 2) gesturing while communicating the transitive action as how the user habitually performs the action (pantomimic action) is perceived to be easier and more natural than gesturing while communicating it as an instruction. These findings provide guidelines for the characteristics of gestures and user mental models one must consciously be concerned with when designing and implementing gesture vocabularies of touchless interaction.},

  abstract = {In modern society there is an increasing demand to access, record and manipulate large amounts of information. This has inspired a new approach to thinking about and designing personal computers, where the ultimate goal is to produce a truly wearable computer. In this work we present a non-invasive hand-gesture recognition system aimed at deictic gestures. Our system is based on the powerful Sequential Monte Carlo framework which is enhanced with respect to increased robustness. This is achieved by using ratios in the likelihood function together with two image cues: edges and skin color. The system proves to be fast, robust towards noise, and quick to lock on to the object (hand). All of which is achieved without the use of special lighting or special markers on the hands, hence our system is a non-invasive solution.},

  abstract = {The elder population is rising worldwide; in the US, no longer being able to drive is a significant marker of loss of independence. One of the approaches to helping elders drive more safely is to investigate the use of automotive user interface technology, and specifically, to explore the instrument panel (IP) display design to help attract and manage attention and make information easier to interpret.  In this paper, we explore the premise that dashboard displays can be better designed to support elder drivers, their information needs, and their cognitive capabilities. We conducted a study to understand which display design features are critically linked to issues of divided attention and driving performance. We found that contrast of size and reduced clutter are instrumental in enhancing driving performance, particularly for the elder population. Surprisingly, our results showed that color elements have a negative effect on driving performance for elders, while color elements and fills slightly improve performance. We conclude with design implications generated from this work.},

@article{Phillips:2010jn,
  abstract = {Technology abandonment may have serious repercussions for individuals with disabilities and for society. The purpose of this study was to determine how technology users decide to accept or reject assistive devices. Two hundred twenty-seven adults with various disabilities responded to a survey on device selection, acquisition, performance, and use. Results showed that 29.3\% of all devices were completely abandoned. Mobility aids were more frequently abandoned than other categories of devices, and abandonment rates were highest during the first year and after 5 years of use. Four factors were significantly related to abandonment\textemdash{}lack of consideration of user opinion in selection, easy device procurement, poor device performance, and change in user needs or priorities. These findings suggest that technology-related policies and services need to emphasize consumer involvement and long-term needs of consumers to reduce device abandonment and enhance consumer satisfaction.},

  abstract = {In this paper we describe MoBoogie, an application that allows users to manipulate and arrange music through movement. MoBoogie is designed to foster experiences in creative expression for children and potentially adults. The application responds to users movements by changing variables in a continuous stream of music loops. Results from this study suggest that the creative expressions arose in the joint space of movement and music, and did not primarily have to be in one form or the other. This allowed users with limited experience in dance and music making to be creative in such forms of expression.},

  abstract = {Gesture interfaces are needed for natural intuitive communication with machine devices. Hand gesture intuitiveness is the cognitive association between a command or intent, and its physical gestural expression. Using an automated tool we quantified intuitive indices for static gesture commands for a car navigation task. A small number of gestures were selected to express most of the commands with 1/3 used only by single individuals. This followed a power function analogous to Zipf's Law for languages. We found gesture preferences to be highly individualized, providing evidence to refute the hypothesis of the universality of gestures. A mathematical program was formulated to obtain a consensus gesture vocabulary for a car navigation system with the objective of maximizing total intuitiveness. We also introduced the notion of complex consensus gesture vocabularies in which multi-gestures are associated with single commands and multi-commands are associated with single gestures. We recommend hybrid gesture vocabularies, decided by consensus with several gestures selected individually.},

  abstract = {In this paper we present a new keyboard interface for computer music applications. Where traditional keyboard controllers report the velocity of each key-press, our interface senses up to five separate dimensions: velocity, percussiveness, rigidity, weight, and depth. These dimensions, which we identified based on the pedagogical piano literature and pilot studies with professional pianists, together present a rich picture of physical gestures at the keyboard, including information on the performers motion before, during, and after a note is played. User studies confirm that the sensed dimensions are intuitive and controllable and that mappings between gesture and sound produce novel, playable musical instruments, even for users without prior keyboard experience. The multidimensional sensing capability demonstrated in this paper is also potentially applicable to button interfaces outside the musical domain.},

  abstract = {An active noise cancellation method using a MEMS accelerometer is developed for recovering corrupted wearable sensor signals due to body motion. The method is developed for a finger ring PPG sensor, the signal of which is susceptive to the hand motion of the wearer. A MEMS accelerometer (ACC) imbedded in the PPG sensor detects the hand acceleration, and is used for recovering the corrupted PPG signal. The correlation between the acceleration and the distorted PPG signal is analyzed, and a low-order FIR model relating the signal distortion to the hand acceleration is obtained. The model parameters are identified in real time with a recursive least square method. Experiments show that the active noise cancellation method can recover ring PPG sensor signals corrupted with 2G of acceleration in the longitudinal direction of the digital artery.},

@inproceedings{Marner:fp,
  abstract = {This paper presents a new technique to simultaneously model in both the physical and virtual worlds. The intended application domain for this technique is industrial design. A designer physically sculpts a 3D model from foam using a hand-held hot wire foam cutter. Both the foam and cutting tool are tracked, allowing the system to digitally replicate the sculpting process to produce a matching 3D virtual model. Spatial Augmented Reality is used to project visualizations onto the foam. Inspired by the needs of industrial designers, we have developed two visualizations for sculpting specific models: Target, which shows where foam needs to be removed to produce a model, and Cut Animation, which projects the paths for cuts to be made to reproduce a previous artifact. A third visualization of the wireframe of the generated model is projected onto the foam and used for verification. The final visualization employs 3D procedural textures such as a wood grain texture, providing a simulation of volumetric rendering. Volumetric rendering techniques such as this provide a more natural look that is projected onto the foam. Once the object has been modeled physically and virtually, the designer is able to annotate and paint the finished model. The system has been evaluated through a user study conducted with students from the School of Industrial Design at the University of South Australia},

Most of the limitations that users experience with current devices will disappear in future generations. These changes will not have an effect on the primary user interface constraint: the display size. The actual screen size will not change, since users demand devices that can be easily carried around and held in one hand. The article presents a hybrid approach to the generation of adaptive UIs based on a linking strategy of hierarchies of graphs. The nodes of this graph consist of clustered UI elements.},

Drawing on the literature on current messaging practises, a new concept for multimodal messaging has been designed and developed. The Shake2Talk system allows users to construct audio-tactile messages through simple gesture interactions, and send these messages to other people. Such messages could be used to communicate a range of meanings, from the practical (e.g. home safely, represented by the sound and sensation of a key turning in a lock) to the emotional (e.g. thinking of you represented by a heartbeat). This paper presents the background to this work, the system design and implementation and a plan for evaluation.},

The classification provides a means of addressing gestures as an interaction mode across the different application domains so that researchers and designers can draw on the vast amount of research that has been addressed within the literature from an interaction perspective.},

The human centered desires (intuitiveness, comfort) of multiple users are implicitly represented through indices obtained from ergonomic studies representing the psycho-physiological aspects of users. The main technical aspect considered is that of machine recognition of gestures. We believe this is the first conceptualization of the optimal hand gesture design problem in analytical form. The problem is formulated as a multicriteria optimization problem (MCOP) for which a 3D representation of the solution space is used to display candidate solutions, as well as Pareto optimal ones. A computational example is given for the design of a small robot command GV using the MCOP procedure.},

I also suggest some things that we could do to make our research community stronger and more able to tackle these problems.},

This approach deals with the particular case where data is specified in terms of its Cartesian coordinates and the errors in both coordinates are not independent. Besides, an associated uncertainty ellipse which describes the measurement error and the variance matrix associated to the estimated parameters are obtained. This method is particularly well designed to fit a circle to a set of measured range readings provided by a 2-D laser range finder when these range readings are specified in terms of its Cartesian coordinates. Therefore, it has been successfully applied to acquire circle-shaped landmarks in a mobile robotics navigation task.},

  abstract = {The complexity of many problems necessitates creating and exploring multiple, alternative solutions. However, current user interfaces do not cleanly support creating alternatives at a time when they are likely to be discovered: as users interactively modify data. This paper presents Parallel Paths, a novel model of interaction that facilitates generating, manipulating, and comparing alternative solutions. In contrast to existing approaches such as automated history capture tools, Parallel Paths emphasizes the active, simultaneous development of multiple, alternative solutions. We demonstrate this model of interaction in Parallel Pies, a user interface mechanism developed for image manipulation tasks that allows users to: easily create solution alternatives as they interact with a command; embed the alternatives in the same workspace; manipulate the alternatives independently or simultaneously as if they were the same object; and perform side-by-side comparisons of each. Results from an initial evaluation are presented, along with implications for future designs.},

  abstract = {Laser cutters are increasingly relevant within many user contexts and have become an essential tool for model building and prototyping. While providing precision and flexibility, these tools are typically suited for expert staff in industrial settings. VAL (Visually Augmented Laser cutting) proposes a novel system utilizing spatial augmented reality techniques to provide visual augmentation directly on the work surface. VAL involves projection of the user's model prior to and during laser cutting providing key benefits including minimizing idle time, reduction of errors, and support for new creative practices. We interview and observe laser cutter users to identify issues and concerns in the shared work context of a design school and describe the design process for our prototype, which aims to address these problems and unmet needs. Initial evaluation suggests VAL reduces complexity and raises user confidence. Our findings extend research on adapting new use contexts and creative practices with industrial fabrication tools.},

The system can be composed in an ad-hoc fashion, by bringing individual devices in proximity with each other. As a consequence it is possible for the user to build the desired system for a given task at hand in a straightforward way, via physical movement and without issuing any explicit configuration commands. System and applications adapt their behavior as a function of the resources provided by the devices that are part of the current system configuration. We give an overview of the runtime support provided to promote development in this highly dynamic setting, with particular focus on adaptive management of storage and user interface resources.},

In this paper, we report ultrathin sound absorbing panels that completely absorb sound energy with a thickness around one percent of wavelength. The strategy is to bend and coil up quarter-wavelength sound damping tubes into 2D coplanar ones, and embed them into a matrix to form sound absorbing panel. Samples have been designed and fabricated by 3D printing. Efficacies of sound absorption by these panels were validated through good agreement between theoretical analysis and experimental measurements.},

The system coherently integrates existing techniques of sketch-based interaction with a number of novel and enhanced features. Novel contributions of the system include automatic view rotation to improve curve sketchability, an axis widget for sketch surface selection, and implicitly inferred changes between sketching techniques. We also improve on a number of existing ideas such as a virtual sketchbook, simplified 2D and 3D view navigation, multi-stroke NURBS curve creation, and a cohesive gesture vocabulary. An evaluation by a professional designer shows the potential of our system for deployment within a real design process.},

@inproceedings{Nguyen:2013ci,
  abstract = {In-situ 3D Modeling becomes increasingly prominent in current Augmented Reality research, particularly for mobile scenarios. However, real-time performance and qualitative modeling remain highly challenging. In this work, we propose a new interactive 3D modeling approach for indoor environments, combining an assistive user interface and constrained reconstruction with a device consisting of a single-point laser range finder and a camera. Using our system, a user pans around capturing a panorama of the environment, while simultaneously measuring the distance to a single point per frame. An automatic detection process estimates planes from these sparse 3D measurements. The user can highlight specific geometric features in the environment, such as 2- or 3-way corners, with simple gestures, adding more 3D points to the estimation. The segmented planes are refined using a constrained optimization, enforcing orthogonality and parallel constraints as well as minimizing the number of planes used in the reconstruction. Finally a volumetric space-carving approach determines the geometry of the environment. Our reconstruction approach can output highly accurate models built only from simple, clean geometry. To examine the quantitative performance of our approach, we run evaluations on both synthetic and real data},

By minimizing the algebraic distance subject to the constraint 4ac E b2 = 1, the new method incorporates the ellipticity constraint into the normalization factor. The proposed method combines several advantages: It is ellipse-specific, so that even bad data will always return an ellipse. It can be solved naturally by a generalized eigensystem. It is extremely robust, efficient, and easy to implement.},

@article{Romero:2008p6475,
  abstract = {In the established procedural model of information visualization, the first operation is to transform raw data into data tables. The transforms typically include abstractions that aggregate and segment relevant data and are usually defined by a human, user or programmer. The theme of this paper is that for video, data transforms should be supported by low level computer vision. High level reasoning still resides in the human analyst, while part of the low level perception is handled by the computer. To illustrate this approach, we present Viz-A-Vis, an overhead video capture and access system for activity analysis in natural settings over variable periods of time. Overhead video provides rich opportunities for long-term behavioral and occupancy analysis, but it poses considerable challenges. We present initial steps addressing two challenges. First, overhead video generates overwhelmingly large volumes of video impractical to analyze manually. Second, automatic video analysis remains an open problem for computer vision.},

  abstract = {The main challenges for mobile usability labs, as measurement instruments, lay not so much on being able to record what happens on the user interface, but capturing the interactional relationship between the user and the environment. An ideal mobile usability lab would enable recording, with sufficient accuracy and reliability, the users deployment of gaze, the hands, the near bodyspace, proximate and distant objects of interest, as well as abrupt environmental events. An inherent complication is that the equipment will affect these events and is affected by them. We argue that a balance between coverage and obtrusiveness must be found on a per case basis. We present a modular solution to mobile usability labs, allowing both beltand backpack-worn configurations and flexible division of equipment between the user, the moderator, and the environment. These benefits were achieved without sacrificing data quality, operational duration, or light weight. We describe system design rationale and report first experiences from a field experiment. Current work concentrates on simplifying the system to improve cost-efficiency.},

  abstract = {Wireless sensor networks can enable numerous embedded computing applications. One of the primary benefits of wireless sensor networks is their independence from the wiring costs and constraints. However, if the batteries must be replaced often (every week or every month), not only will the initial cost savings be lost, but also many remote sensing applications may become impractical. Therefore, long battery life (in the order of years) is essential; power efficiency is a critical requirement for wireless sensor networks. We have devised several novel techniques for minimizing power consumption in wireless sensor networks. Based on these techniques, we have developed a highly power-efficient sensor networking platform called the i-Bean Network. In this paper, we describe these techniques in detail and the associated tradeoffs.},

With its low cost and scalability, crowdsourcing presents an attractive option for evaluating the large design space of visualizations; however, it first requires validation. In this paper, we assess the viability of Amazons Mechanical Turk as a platform for graphical perception experiments. We replicate previous studies of spatial encoding and luminance contrast and compare our results. We also conduct new experiments on rectangular area perception (as in treemaps or cartograms) and on chart size and gridline spacing. Our results demonstrate that crowdsourced perception experiments are viable and contribute new insights for visualization design. Lastly, we report cost and performance data from our experiments and distill recommendations for the design of crowdsourced studies.},

  abstract = {The rapid and accelerating move towards use of mobile technologies has increasingly provided people and organizations with the ability to work away from the office and on the move. The new ways of working afforded by these technologies are often characterized in terms of access to information and people anytime, anywhere. This article presents a study of mobile workers that highlights different facets of access to remote people and information, and different facets of anytime, anywhere. Four key factors in mobile work are identified: the role of planning, working in "dead time," accessing remote technological and informational resources, and monitoring the activities of remote colleagues. By reflecting on these issues, we can better understand the role of technology and artifacts in mobile work and identify the opportunities for the development of appropriate technological solutions to support mobile workers.},

  abstract = {We present the MotionBeam metaphor for character interaction with handheld projectors. Our work draws from the tradition of pre-cinema handheld projectors that use direct physical manipulation to control projected imagery. With our prototype system, users interact and control projected characters by moving and gesturing with the handheld projector itself. This creates a unified interaction style where input and output are tied together within a single device. We introduce a set of interaction principles and present prototype applications that provide clear examples of the MotionBeam metaphor in use. Finally we describe observations and insights from a preliminary user study with our system.},

It provides a transparent user interface which takes advantage of physical user actions for the purpose of directory management, data sharing and document location tracking. This is achieved by digitally augmenting both documents and document containers to detect the location of physical information and to trigger corresponding update actions in the electronic world. The system is built using the Datlet [9] architecture to allow any tool-objects to be applied to data-objects, thereby enabling an even more natural user interaction based on affordances.},

Surgical management, prosthetic fitting options, and training regimens have progressed substantially over the past several decades. Clinicians should be familiar with the available technological options to provide children with amputations the best possible care. The plethora of small components available for lower- and upper-limb prostheses indicates the desirability of managing juvenile patients in an interdisciplinary, specialized clinical setting where the advantages and disadvantages of prosthetic options can be related to the particular needs and wishes of each young client and the client's family. Although prostheses are not anatomical avatars, careful appliance prescription and training, coordinated with the child's growth and developmental changes, can optimize the benefits the child derives from the prosthesis.},

We then discuss synchronization strategies for sensorimotor coupling pertaining to rhythmic entrainment mechanisms; followed by trajectory cuing and optimization models as they relate to rhythmic entrainment and movement control; and, finally, the outlook for applications that may help rehabilitate motor function. Our interest in the study of the connections between rhythm, time, and the control of movement was stimulated from three directions: (a) the study of high-level motor control in musicians and the effect of rhythmic cues on muscle activity in cello performance; (b) the evidence that auditory rhythmic patterns exert a strong magnet effect on the timing of motor responses; and (c) the clinical observation that music-therapy techniques that were originally designed for socio-emotional needs elicited motor responses in neurologically impaired patients that were not readily accessible by other therapies.},

We discuss an observational study in which we collected common holds used when pointing on a mockup paper display. We also measured the force patterns each hold generated within the display surface. We analyzed this data to produce 3 force zones in the display for each of the four most frequently observed holds: the grip zone, rigid zone, and the flexible zone. We report on an empirical evaluation in which we compared the efficiency of pointing and dragging operations between holds, and between structural zones within holds, using a real flexible Lumalive display. Results suggest that structural force distributions in a flexible display affect the Index of Performance of both pointing and dragging tasks, irrespective of hold, with rigid parts of the display yielding a 12\% average performance gain over flexible areas.},

  abstract = {Touch screen surfaces large enough for ten-finger input have become increasingly popular, yet typing on touch screens pales in comparison to physical keyboards. We examine typing patterns that emerge when expert users of physical keyboards touch-type on a flat surface. Our aim is to inform future designs of touch screen keyboards, with the ultimate goal of supporting touch-typing with limited tactile feedback. To study the issues inherent to flat-glass typing, we asked 20 expert typists to enter text under three conditions: (1) with no visual keyboard and no feedback on input errors, then (2) with and (3) without a visual keyboard, but with some feedback. We analyzed touch contact points and hand contours, looking at attributes such as natural finger positioning, the spread of hits among individual keys, and the pattern of non-finger touches. We also show that expert typists exhibit spatially consistent key press distributions within an individual, which provides evidence that eyes-free touch-typing may be possible on touch surfaces and points to the role of personalization in such a solution. We conclude with implications for design.},

  abstract = {Geographic information has spawned many novel Web applications where global positioning system (GPS) plays important roles in bridging the applications and end users. Learning knowledge from users raw GPS data can provide rich context information for both geographic and mobile applications. However, so far, raw GPS data are still used directly without much understanding. In this paper, an approach based on supervised learning is proposed to automatically infer transportation mode from raw GPS data. The transportation mode, such as walking, driving, etc., implied in a users GPS data can provide us valuable knowledge to understand the user. It also enables context-aware computing based on users present transportation mode and design of an innovative user interface for Web users. Our approach consists of three parts: a change point based segmentation method, an inference model and a post processing algorithm based on conditional probability. The change point-based segmentation method was compared with two baselines including uniform duration based and uniform length based methods. Meanwhile, four different inference models including Decision Tree, Bayesian Net, Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Conditional Random Field (CRF) are studied in the experiments. We evaluated the approach using the GPS data collected by 45 users over six months period. As a result, beyond other two segmentation methods, the change point based method achieved a higher degree of accuracy in predicting transportation modes and detecting transitions between them. Decision Tree outperformed other inference models over the change point based segmentation method.},

Tangible Bots can reflect changes in the digital model and assist users by haptic feedback, by correcting errors, by multi-touch control, and by allowing efficient interaction with multiple tangibles. A first study shows that Tangible Bots are usable for fine-grained manipulation (e.g., rotating tangibles to a particular orientation); for coarse movements, Tangible Bots become useful only when several tangibles are controlled simultaneously. Participants prefer Tangible Bots and find them less taxing than passive, non-motorized tangibles. A second study focuses on usefulness by studying how electronic musicians use Tangible Bots to create music with a tangible tabletop application. We conclude by discussing the further potential of active tangibles, and their relative benefits over passive tangibles and multi-touch.},

@article{Lee:2014gl,
  abstract = {Smartphones have become indispensable computational tools. However, some tasks can be difficult to perform on a smartphone because these devices have small displays. Here, we explore methods for augmenting the display of a smartphone, or other PDA, using interactive paper. Specifically, we present a prototype interface that enables a user to interactively interrogate technical drawings using an Anoto-based smartpen and a PDA. Our software system, called PaperCAD, enables users to query geometric information from CAD drawings printed on Anoto dot-patterned paper. For example, the user can measure a distance by drawing a dimension arrow. The system provides output to the user via a smartpen{{\&}}{{\#}}x2019;s audio speaker and the dynamic video display of a PDA. The user can select either verbose or concise audio feedback, and the PDA displays a video image of the portion of the drawing near the pen tip. The project entails advances in the interpretation of pen input, such as a method that uses contextual information to interpret ambiguous dimensions and a technique that uses a hidden Markov model to correct interpretation errors in handwritten equations. Results of a user study suggest that our user interface design and interpretation techniques are effective and that users are highly satisfied with the system.},

  abstract = {An Open Source Software (OSS) project is unlikely to be successful unless there is an accompanied community that provides the platform for developers and users to collaborate. Members of such communities are volunteers whose motivation to participate and contribute is of essential importance to the success of OSS projects. In this paper, we aim to create an understanding of what motivates people to participate in OSS communities. We theorize that learning is one of the motivational forces. Our theory is grounded in the learning theory of Legitimate Peripheral Participation, and is supported by analyzing the social structure of OSS communities and the co-evolution between OSS systems and communities. We also discuss practical implications of our theory for creating and maintaining sustainable OSS communities as well as for software engineering research and education},

  abstract = {Information representation in augmented and virtual reality systems, and social physical (building) spaces can enhance the efficacy of interacting with and assimilating abstract, non-visual data. Sonification is the process of automatically generated real time information representation. There is a gap in our implementation and knowledge of auditory display systems used to enhance interaction in virtual and augmented reality. This paper addresses that gap by examining methodologies for mapping socio-spatial data to spatialised sonification manipulated with gestural controllers. This is a system of interactive knowledge representation that completes the human integration loop, enabling the user to interact with and manipulate data using 3D spatial gesture and 3D auditory display. Benefits include 1) added immersion in an augmented or virtual reality interface; 2) auditory display avoids visual overload in visually-saturated processes such as designing, evacuation in emergencies, flying aircraft; computer gaming; and 3) bi-modal or auditory representation, due to its time-based character, facilitates cognition of complex information.},

In this paper we describe vision-based head gesture recognition techniques and their use for common user interface commands. We explore two prototype perceptual interface components which use detected head gestures for dialog box confirmation and document browsing, respectively. Tracking is performed using stereo-based alignment, and recognition proceeds using a trained discriminative classifier. An additional context learning component is described, which exploits interface context to obtain robust performance. User studies with prototype recognition components indicate quantitative and qualitative benefits of gesture-based confirmation over conventional alternatives.},

@article{Webb:2006p1260,
  abstract = {We used human movement as the basis for designing a collaborative aesthetic design environment. Our intention was to promote social interaction and creative expression. We employed off-the-shelf computer vision technology. Movement became the basis for the choreography of gestures, the development of gesture recognition, and the development of imagery and visualization. We discovered that the design of clear affordances is no less important in movement-based than in mouse-based systems. Through an integrated and iterative design process, we developed a new type of affordance, the choreographic button, which integrates choreography, gesture recognition, and visual feedback. Jumping, a quick movement, and crouching, a sustained gesture, were choreographed to form a vocabulary that is personally expressive, and which also facilitates automatic recognition.How can we evaluate socially motivated interactive systems? To create a context for evaluation, we held an integrated exhibition, party, and user study event. This mixing of events produced an engaging environment in which participants could choose to interact with each other, as well as with the design environment. We prepared a mouse-based version of the design environment, and compared how people experienced it with the movementbased system. Our study demonstrates that movement-based affordances promote social interaction.},

  abstract = {Modern mobile phones enable users to access a wide variety of information and communication services anytime and anywhere. In order for people with disabilities to benefit from these services, mobile devices must provide accessible user interfaces. Currently, users with motor and visual impairments often have difficulty using mobile devices due to issues such as screen readability and small controls. These problems may be exacerbated when attempting to use such devices in crowded, noisy or otherwise distracting environments. We are developing accessible mobile interaction techniques that adapt the mobile device interface to the user by leveraging information about the user's current location, activity, and level of ability.},

The approach includes the use of tangible free form models as tools for improving the overall learning. The paper is based on lecturer and student experiences obtained through facilitated discussions during the course as well as through a survey distributed to the participating students. The analysis of the experiences shows a mixed picture consisting of both benefits and limits to the experimental technique. A discussion about the applicability of the technique and about the needed adjustments concludes the paper.},

@article{Lichtenauer:2008p4341,
  abstract = {To recognize speech, handwriting, or sign language, many hybrid approaches have been proposed that combine Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) or Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) with discriminative classifiers. However, all methods rely directly on the likelihood models of DTW/HMM. We hypothesize that time warping and classification should be separated because of conflicting likelihood modeling demands. To overcome these restrictions, we propose using Statistical DTW (SDTW) only for time warping, while classifying the warped features with a different method. Two novel statistical classifiers are proposed\textemdash{}Combined Discriminative Feature Detectors (CDFDs) and Quadratic Classification on DF Fisher Mapping (Q-DFFM)\textemdash{}both using a selection of discriminative features (DFs), and are shown to outperform HMM and SDTW. However, we have found that combining likelihoods of multiple models in a second classification stage degrades performance of the proposed classifiers, while improving performance with HMM and SDTW. A proof-of-concept experiment, combining DFFM mappings of multiple SDTW models with SDTW likelihoods, shows that, also for model-combining, hybrid classification can provide significant improvement over SDTW. Although recognition is mainly based on 3D hand motion features, these results can be expected to generalize to recognition with more detailed measurements such as hand/body pose and facial expression.},

  abstract = {A user task often spans multiple heterogeneous devices, e.g., working on a PC in the office and continuing the work on a laptop or a mobile phone while commuting on a shuttle. However, there is a lack of support for users to easily migrate their tasks across devices. To address this problem, we created Deep Shot, a framework for capturing the users work state that is needed for a task (e.g., the specific part of a webpage being viewed) and resuming it on a different device. In particular, Deep Shot supports two novel and intuitive interaction techniques, deep shooting and deep posting, for pulling and pushing work states, respectively, using a mobile phone camera. In addition, Deep Shot provides a concise API for developers to leverage its services and make their application states migratable. We demonstrated that Deep Shot can be used to support a range of everyday tasks migrating across devices. An evaluation consisting of a series of experiments showed that our framework and techniques are feasible.},

In most such studies of reciprocal aiming, participants have been required to make reaching or pointing movements in space to targets of varying size. We wished to extend this body of work to a situation in which participants had to use a steering wheel in order to move a cursor on a computer monitor. Our results revealed a positive linear relationship between movement times and movement difficulty. We also observed an increased con- tribution of nonlinear dynamical terms as the movement difficulty increased. These results are consistent with the claim that a linear speed\textendash{}difficulty relationship is a general feature of human motor control and one which is effector- independent. These results have relevant application to the study of human driving performance.},

Thermal sensing has had limited examination in the HCI research community and is generally under-explored outside of law enforcement and energy auditing applications. We examine the role of thermal imaging as a new sensing solution for enhancing user surface interaction. In particular, we demonstrate how thermal imaging in combination with existing computer vision techniques can make segmentation and detection of routine interaction techniques possible in real-time, and can be used to complement or simplify algorithms for traditional RGB and depth cameras. Example interactions include (1) distinguishing hovering above a surface from touch events, (2) shape-based gestures similar to ink strokes, (3) pressure based gestures, and (4) multi-finger gestures. We close by discussing the practicality of thermal sensing for naturalistic user interaction and opportunities for future work.},

  abstract = {Received signal strength indication (RSSI)-based localization is emerging in wireless sensor networks (WSNs). Localization algorithms need to include the physical and hardware limitations of RSSI measurements in order to give more accurate results in dynamic real-life indoor environments. In this study, we use the Interdisciplinary Institute for Broadband Technology real-life test bed and present an automated method to optimize and calibrate the experimental data before offering them to a positioning engine. In a preprocessing localization step, we introduce a new method to provide bounds for the range, thereby further improving the accuracy of our simple and fast 2D localization algorithm based on corrected distance circles. A maximum likelihood algorithm with a mean square error cost function has a higher position error median than our algorithm. Our experiments further show that the complete proposed algorithm eliminates outliers and avoids any manual calibration procedure.},

@article{Mueen:2009wi,
  abstract = {Time series motifs are pairs of individual time series, or subsequences of a longer time series, which are very similar to each other. As with their discrete analogues in computational biology, this similarity hints at structure which has been conserved for some reason and may therefore be of interest. Since the formalism of time series motifs in 2002, dozens of researchers have used them for diverse applications in many different domains. Because the obvious algorithm for computing motifs is quadratic in the number of items, more than a dozen approximate algorithms to discover motifs have been proposed in the literature. In this work, for the first time, we show a tractable exact algorithm to find time series motifs. As we shall show through extensive experiments, our algorithm is up to three orders of magnitude faster than brute-force search in large datasets. We further show that our algorithm is fast enough to be used as a subroutine in higher level data mining algorithms for anytime classification, near-duplicate detection and summarization, and we consider detailed case studies in domains as diverse as electroencephalograph interpretation and entomological telemetry data mining.},

We introduce Apolo, a system that uses a mixed-initiative approach\textemdash{}combining visualization, rich user interaction and machine learning\textemdash{}to guide the user to incrementally and interactively explore large network data and make sense of it. Apolo engages the user in bottom-up sensemaking to gradually build up an understanding over time by starting small, rather than starting big and drilling down. Apolo also helps users find relevant information by specifying exemplars, and then using a machine learning method called Belief Propagation to infer which other nodes may be of interest. We evaluated Apolo with twelve participants in a between-subjects study, with the task being to find relevant new papers to update an existing survey paper. Using expert judges, participants using Apolo found significantly more relevant papers. Subjective feedback of Apolo was also very positive.},

Using a single, relatively stiff printer material, our method designs an assembly of small-scale microstructures that have the effect of a softer material at the object scale, with properties depending on the microstructure used in each part of the object. We build on work in the area of metamaterials, using numerical optimization to design tiled microstructures with desired properties, but with the key difference that our method designs \ldots{}},

@article{Olwal:2008p7320,
  abstract = {We introduce two families of techniques, rubbing and tapping, that use zooming to make possible precise interaction on passive touch screens, and describe examples of each. Rub-Pointing uses a diagonal rubbing gesture to integrate pointing and zooming in a single-handed technique. In contrast, Zoom-Tapping is a two-handed technique in which the dominant hand points, while the non-dominant hand taps to zoom, simulating multi-touch functionality on a single-touch display. Rub-Tapping is a hybrid technique that integrates rubbing with the dominant hand to point and zoom, and tapping with the non-dominant hand to confirm selection. We describe the results of a formal user study comparing these techniques with each other and with the well-known Take-Off and Zoom-Pointing selection techniques. Rub-Pointing and Zoom-Tapping had significantly fewer errors than Take-Off for small targets, and were significantly faster than Take-Off and Zoom-Pointing. We show how the techniques can be used for fluid interaction in an image viewer and in Google Maps.},

The mode and purpose of wearing jewellery make it an appropriate choice as a controlling device in physical computing (Wallace and Dearden, 2005). The challenge for the craftsperson is to demonstrate that craft thinking can add to the field of interaction design through the application of knowledge and understanding of the cultural and personal significance of the worn object and an understanding of materials and processes.},

The first part describes a number of wearable HCI systems that use different technologies in order to include gestures into their interface. Furthermore, it also compares the different technologies with respect to certain general HCI aspects. The second part describes a three-class taxonomy for the computer vision-based technology and gives examples within each of the classes.},

  abstract = {Context-aware applications are applications that implicitly take their context of use into account by adapting to changes in a user's activities and environments. No one has more intimate knowledge about these activities and environments than end-users themselves. Currently there is no support for end-users to build context-aware applications for these dynamic settings. To address this issue, we present a CAPpella, a programming by demonstration Context-Aware Prototyping environment intended for end-users. Users "program" their desired context-aware behavior (situation and associated action) in situ, without writing any code, by demonstrating it to a CAPpella and by annotating the relevant portions of the demonstration. Using a meeting and medicine-taking scenario, we illustrate how a user can demonstrate different behaviors to a CAPpella. We describe a CAPpella's underlying system to explain how it supports users in building behaviors and present a study of 14 end-users to illustrate its feasibility and usability.},

@article{Hanheide:2005p471,
  abstract = {As wearable sensors and computing hardware are becoming a real ity, new and unorthodox approaches to seamless human-computer interaction can be explored. This paper presents the prototype of a wearable, head-mounted device for advanced human-machine in teraction that integrates speech recognition and computer vision with head gesture analysis based on inertial sensor data. We will focus on the innovative idea of integrating visual and inertial data processing for interaction. Fusing head gestures with results from visual analysis of the environment provides rich vocabularies for human-machine communication because it renders the environ ment into an interface: if objects or items in the surroundings are being associated with system activities, head gestures can trigger commands if the corresponding object is being looked at. We will explain the algorithmic approaches applied in our prototype and present experiments that highlight its potential for assistive tech nology. Apart from pointing out a new direction for seamless in teraction in general, our approach provides a new and easy to use interface for disabled and paralyzed users in particular.},

  abstract = {Congenital upper limb differences are physical health conditions in which an individual is born with abnormalities of the upper limbs (i.e., arms, hands, and/or fingers). This article presents a qualitative study about the unique strengths, challenges, and relationship processes in families of children with congenital upper limb differences. Four in-depth focus groups were conducted with parents of children with congenital upper limb differences. Content analysis procedures were used to analyze the data. The results indicated the following: (a) The strengths and resources of these families included a belief in the human universality of differences, connections with similar families, reliance on a strong social support network, and humor; (b) the challenges the families faced included managing grief-related emotions, making medical decisions, and promoting the child's development; and (c) family relationships were affected through the parents' expression of emotion, opportunities for closeness, and relationships with other family members, such as extended family and siblings.

  abstract = {3D printing is described as the next industrial revolution bringing manufacturing to the home. However, its attraction to the home or non-technical user is frustrated by the difficulty in deploying the software and the technology which both need professional understanding and training. Research and innovation in this area has concentrated on technology, not users and usability. Home users can access simple design software tools, best described as good for one task only. Software such as Microsoft word and Excel have been the subject of development for enabling most people to use computers without the need for training or the ability to program. However research in the home users of 3-D printing is very limited. This literature review is concerned is an investigation into home/non-technical use of 3-D printers, their needs and limitations, in order to facilitate the development of effective tools and manuals. An investigation of literature and a survey supported by a focus group of 42 university students aims to understand the way home/non-technical users currently use designs, and how they can to adapt/change their designs for effective use of 3-D printing. This will identify the tools/apps needed for accessible understanding and deployment of the technology.},

A low-power transmitter-receiver concept of low-complexity is a crucial factor for maintaining low costs and battery life in a distributed on-body sensor network. This paper presents such a transmission system based on inductive coupling giving a locomotion sensor mounted on the boot as example.},

Inspired by this medium, we have developed a new multi-touch digital artistic medium named SandCanvas that simplifies the creation of sand animations. SandCanvas also goes beyond traditional sand animation with tools for mixing sand animation with video and replicating recorded free-form hand gestures. In this paper, we analyze common sand animation hand gestures, present SandCanvass intuitive UI, and describe implementation challenges we encountered. We also present an evaluation with professional and novice artists that shows the importance and unique affordances of this new medium.},

Since gestures are usual methods of non-verbal communications and enables sensuous operations for users, many researches on them carried out especially in the field of Virtual Reality. However most of those existing gesture-input systems are either very expensive or large, and have not been used in mobile environment. In contrast, Ubi-Finger is a gesture-input device, which is simple, compact, and optimized for mobile use. We develop prototype systems, and evaluate how effective our approach works.},

The efficacy of the system has been demonstrated by commercial deployments at Walt Disney World Resort and Star Wars Celebration VI in Orlando Florida. Although the system is semi automated, human intervention is limited to a few simple tasks to maintain the high throughput and consistent quality required for commercial application. In contrast to existing systems that fabricate custom heads that are assembled to pre-fabricated plastic bodies, our system seamlessly integrates 3D facial data with a predefined figurine body into a unique and continuous object that is fabricated as a single piece. The combination of state-of-the-art 3D capture, modelling, and printing that are the core of our system provide the flexibility to fabricate figurines whose complexity is only limited by the creativity of the designer},

  abstract = {Physical controls for most devices are either one size fits all or require custom hardware for each user. Cost often prohibits custom design, and each user must adapt to the standard device interface, typically with a loss of precision and efficiency. When user abilities vary widely, such as in the disabled community, devices often become unusable. Our goal is to create a system that will track user gestures and interpret them as control signals for devices. Existing gesture recognition research converts continuous body motion into discrete symbols. Our approach is to map continuous motions into a set of analog device control signals. Our system will allow us to quickly tailor a device interface to each users best physical range of motion. Our first application domain is a speech synthesizer for disabled users. We expect two major areas of applicability for non-disabled users: in telemanipulator interfaces, and as a design tool for creating biomechanically efficient interfaces.},

  abstract = {An ID recognition system is described that uses optical beacons and a high-speed image sensor. The ID sensor captures a scene like an ordinary camera and recognizes the ID of a beacon emitted over a long distance. The ID recognition system has three features. The system is robust to changes in the optical environment, e.g. complete darkness, spotlights, and sunlight. It can recognize up to 255 multiple optical beacons simultaneously. Furthermore, it can recognize beacons even over a long distance, e.g. 40 m indoors and 20 m outdoors. Implementation and evaluation of this ID recognition system showed that a mobile augmented reality system can be achieved by combining this ID recognition system with a PDA and a wireless network.

This paper presents innovative Sandbox human information interaction capabilities and the rationale underlying them including direct observations of analysis work as well as structured interviews. Key capabilities for the Sandbox include "put-this-there" cognition, automatic process model templates, gestures for the fluid expression of thought, assertions with evidence and scalability mechanisms to support larger analysis tasks. The Sandbox integrates advanced computational linguistic functions using a Web Services interface and protocol. An independent third party evaluation experiment with the Sandbox has been completed. The experiment showed that analyst subjects using the Sandbox did higher quality analysis in less time than with standard tools. Usability test results indicated the analysts became proficient in using the Sandbox with three hours of training.},

  abstract = {Abstract Solid Freeform Fabrication (SFF) refers to a class of rapid manufacturing process that builds parts by incremental material deposition and fusion of thin 2-1/2 dimensional layers. Over this past decade, SFF has taken the manufacturing industry to new heights. However, parts produced by SFF processes exhibit a stair-step surface texture due to the presence of 2-1/2 dimensional layers and exhibit limited material properties. These issues are addressed by a modified SFF process called Shape Deposition Manufacturing. Shape \ldots{}},

  abstract = {Mainstream PIM tools capture only a portion of the information that people need to manage. Many information scraps seem to exist that don't make their way into these tools, instead being relegated to sticky notes, text files, and other makeshift storage, or simply being lost. In an effort to understand the role of these information scraps, the underlying needs they reflect, and the way PIM tools must be modified to support those needs, we created List-it, a micronote tool for quick and simple capture of information scraps.    In this article, we analyze the notes and interaction logs of 420 volunteer users of List-it over a two-year period of study (August 2008-August 2010). We contextualize our analysis with results of two surveys and an e-mail interview we conducted in October 2009. We find that people are drawn to List-it by the ease and speed of note capture and by the ability to record scraps with arbitrary content that blends or completely escapes the types and roles imposed by our rigid PIM tools. Notes are taken to serve a variety of needs \textendash{} reminding, reference, journaling/activity logging, brainstorming, and to indefinitely archive information of sentimental or personal value. Finally, while people differ considerably in the ways they keep information, our findings suggest such differences can be described as a combination of four distinct strategies, enriching the Filer/Piler distinction identified for classic document management.},

VJs are visual artists who use digital media to express themselves to an audience during a live audio-visual performance. Those designing for the expressive use of technology can gain insight from an articulation of expressive interaction from the perspective of VJ practice. This is developed using a novel qualitative methodology designed to be sensitive to the subtle and tacit nature of expression. We detail our methodology, present the results of its application to a group of VJs and conclude with a discussion of the implications our findings may have for those wishing to design for VJs, or those in related domains that involve expressive interaction with technology.},

The input granularity can be controlled in a natural way by varying the amount of cloth pinched. Pinstripe input elements physically consist of fields of parallel conductive lines sewn onto the fabric. This way, they can be invisi- ble, and can be included across large areas of a garment. Pinstripe also addresses several problems previously identi- fied in the placement and operation of textile UI elements on smart clothing. Two user studies evaluate ideal placement and orientation of Pinstripe elements on the users garments as well as acceptance and perceived ease of use of this novel textile input technique.},

  abstract = {Energy storage is quickly becoming the limiting factor in mobile pervasive technology. For intelligent wearable applications to be practical, methods for low power activity recognition must be embedded in mobile devices. We present a novel method for activity recognition which leverages the predictability of human behavior to conserve energy. The novel algorithm accomplishes this by quantifying activity-sensor dependencies, and using prediction methods to identify likely future activities. Sensors are then identified which can be temporarily turned off at little or no recognition cost. The approach is implemented and simulated using an activity recognition data set, revealing that large savings in energy are possible at very low cost (e.g. 84\% energy savings for a loss of 1.2 pp in recognition).

Evaluation results show that physical resizing of the display can improve the way we interact with digital contents on mobile devices.},

Both devices allow users to interact with wearable or nearby computers by using gesture-based commands. Both are designed to be as unobtrusive as possible, so they can be used under various social contexts. The first device, called Gesture Wrist, is a wristband-type input device that recognizes hand gestures and forearm movements. Unlike DataGloves or other hand gesture-input devices, all sensing elements are embedded in a normal wristband. The second device, called Gesturepad, is a sensing module that can be attached on the inside of clothes, and users can in teract with this module from the outside. It transforms con ventional clothes into an interactive device without chang ing their appearance.},

There is a need for new methods and tools to support development of nomadic applications, which can be accessed through a variety of devices. We present a solution, based on the use of three levels of abstractions, that allows designers to focus on the relevant logical aspects and avoid dealing with a plethora of low-level details. We have defined a number of transformations able to obtain user interfaces from such abstractions, taking into account the available platforms and their interaction modalities while preserving usability. The transformations are supported by an authoring tool, TERESA, which provides designers and developers with various levels of automatic support and several possibilities for tailoring such transformations to their needs.},

  abstract = {People routinely rely on Internet search engines to support their use of interactive systems: they issue queries to learn how to accomplish tasks, troubleshoot problems, and otherwise educate themselves on products. Given this common behavior, we argue that search query logs can usefully augment traditional usability methods by revealing the primary tasks and needs of a product's user population. We term this use of search query logs CUTS \textendash{} characterizing usability through search. In this paper, we introduce CUTS and describe an automated process for harvesting, ordering, labeling, filtering, and grouping search queries related to a given product. Importantly, this data set can be assembled in minutes, is timely, has a high degree of ecological validity, and is arguably less prone to self-selection bias than data gathered via traditional usability methods. We demonstrate the utility of this approach by applying it to a number of popular software and hardware systems.},

  abstract = {The paper addresses the requirement to support component mobility. Field studies of bike messenger operations in Oslo and New York City has been conducted to inform design. We have investigated how component mobility is critical for enabling tailoring of personal mobility in general, and on-body off-body mobility specifically. We suggest that taking mobility seriously may not only contribute to our understanding of current support for mobility, but also raise more general issues concerning requirements and design of mobile technologies. Instead of building a terminal by integrating several terminals into one, our approach suggests first, a dissolution of the current terminals into pieces called basic components and then reassemble the selected basic components to form a customized terminal},

Geckos are based on low-cost permanent magnets and can also be used on non-horizontal surfaces. Unique pressure footprints are used to identify each tangible Gecko. Two types of tangible object designs are presented: Using a single magnet in combination with felt pads provides new pressure-based interaction modalities. Using multiple separate magnets it is possible to change the marker footprint dynamically and create new haptic experiences. The tangible object design and interaction are illustrated with example applications. We also give details on the feasibility and benefits of our tracking approach and show compatibility with other tracking technologies.},

  abstract = {In games where skills such as targeting are critical to winning, it is difficult for players with different skill levels to have a competitive and engaging experience. Although several mechanisms for accommodating different skill levels have been proposed, traditional approaches can be too obvious and can change the nature of the game. For games involving aiming, we propose the use of target assistance techniques (such as area cursors, target gravity, and sticky targets) to accommodate skill imbalances. We compared three techniques in a study, and found that area cursors and target gravity significantly reduced score differential in a shooting-gallery game. Further, less skilled players reported having more fun when the techniques helped them be more competitive, and even after they learned assistance was given, felt that this form of balancing was good for group gameplay. Our results show that target assistance techniques can make target-based games more competitive for shared play.},

The note attached to the side of the monitor, the papers spread out on the desk, diagrams scrawled on a whiteboard, and even the keys left out on the counter are all examples of using space to recall, reveal relationships, and think. Technological advances have made it possible to construct large display environments in which space has real meaning. This paper examines how increased space affects the way displays are regarded and used within the context of the cognitively demanding task of sensemaking. A pair of studies were conducted demonstrating how the spatial environment supports sensemaking by becoming part of the distributed cognitive process, providing both external memory and a semantic layer.},

The research problem is how to promote and guide the use of new movement interaction modalities to a novice user, who has no prior knowledge of gesture control. The aim was to create a pleasurable experience that invites users to learn how mobile device movement control works. The main contribution is an interaction tutorial application that combines gesture control with a physical visual tangible object in a mobile device, demonstrating interaction elements that are potentially applicable in future mobile devices.},

  abstract = {Computer aided design applications have become designers' inevitable tools for expressing and simulating innovative ideas and concepts. However, replacing traditional materials and mock-ups with 3D CAD systems, designers are faced with the intangibility problem, unable to physically interact with test products in early stages of design process. As a touchable and graspable interface based on 3D CAD data, we propose augmented foam, which applies augmented reality technologies to physical blue foams. Using augmented foam, a blue foam mock-up is overlaid with a 3D virtual object, which is rendered with the same CAD model used for mock-up production. We presented a method to correct occlusions of the virtual products by user's hand. Augmented foam was tested for a mug design and a cleaning robot design. Designers were able to inspect and evaluate the design alternatives interactively and efficiently},

The creation of camera-based interfaces is outside the skill-set of most programmers and completely beyond the skills of most interface designers. Image Processing with Crayons is a tool for creating new camera-based interfaces using a simple painting metaphor. A transparent layers model is used to present the designer with all of the necessary information. Traditional machine learning algorithms have been modified to accommodate the rapid response time required of an interactive design tool.},

  abstract = {The proliferation of accelerometers on consumer electronics has brought an opportunity for interaction based on gestures or physical manipulation of the devices. We present uWave, an efficient recognition algorithm for such interaction using a single three-axis accelerometer. Unlike statistical methods, uWave requires a single training sample for each gesture pattern and allows users to employ personalized gestures and physical manipulations. We evaluate uWave using a large gesture library with over 4000 samples collected from eight users over an elongated period of time for a gesture vocabulary with eight gesture patterns identified by a Nokia research. It shows that uWave achieves 98.6\% accuracy, competitive with statistical methods that require significantly more training samples. Our evaluation data set is the largest and most extensive in published studies, to the best of our knowledge. We also present applications of uWave in gesture-based user authentication and interaction with three-dimensional mobile user interfaces using user created gestures.},

  abstract = {Mid-air haptics technologies are able to convey haptic sensations without any direct contact between the user and the haptic interface. One representative example of this technology is ultrasound haptics, which uses ultrasonic phased arrays to deliver haptic sensations. Research on ultrasound haptics is only in its beginnings, and the literature still lacks principled perception studies in this domain. This paper presents a series of human subject experiments investigating important perceptual aspects related to the rendering of 2D shapes by an ultrasound haptic interface (the Ultrahaptics STRATOS platform). We carried out four user studies aiming at evaluating (i) the absolute detection threshold for a static focal point rendered via amplitude modulation, (ii) the absolute detection and identification thresholds for line patterns rendered via spatiotemporal modulation, (iii) the ability to discriminate different line orientations, and (iv) the ability to perceive virtual bumps and holes. These results shed light on the rendering capabilities and limitations of this novel technology for 2D shapes.},

  abstract = {Historically, the development of computer systems has been primarily a technology-driven phenomenon, with technologists believing that "users can adapt" to whatever they build. Human-centered design advocates that a more promising and enduring approach is to model users' natural behavior to begin with so that interfaces can be designed that are more intuitive, easier to learn, and freer of performance errors. In this paper, we illustrate different user-centered design principles and specific strategies, as well as their advantages and the manner in which they enhance users' performance. We also summarize recent research findings from our lab comparing the performance characteristics of different educational interfaces that were based on user-centered design principles. One theme throughout our discussion is human-centered design that minimizes users' cognitive load, which effectively frees up mental resources for performing better while also remaining more attuned to the world around them.},

  abstract = {Much of the mobile work by HCI researchers explores a future world populated by high-end devices and relatively affluent users. This paper turns to consider the hundreds of millions of people for whom such sophistication will not be realised for many years to come. In developing world contexts, people will continue to rely on voice-primary interactions due to both literacy and economic reasons. Here, we motivate research into how to accommodate advanced mobile interface techniques while overcoming the handset, data-connection and user limitations. As a first step we introduce TapBack: back-of-device taps to control a dialled-up, telephone-network-based voice service. We show how these audio gestures might be recognised over a standard telephone connection, via users' existing low-end devices. Further, in a longitudinal deployment, the techniques were made available on a live voice service used by rural Indian farmers. Data from the study illustrates the desire by users to adopt the approach and its potential extensions.},

People can share during a phone call and sharing ends when the call ends. Newport also supports using a computer during a call to make it easier to share content from the phone or launch screen sharing if the caller is also at a computer. We describe Newports system design and a formative evaluation with 12 participants to study their experience using Newport to share location, receive directions, share photos, and perform desktop sharing. Participants preferred using Newport to current methods for these tasks. They also preferred limiting sharing location to phone calls compared with publishing it continuously. Tying sharing to a phone call gives individuals a social sense of security, providing a mechanism for exchanging information with unknown people.},

@article{MullerTomfelde:2006p282,
  abstract = {This paper describes the role and the use of an explicit task representation in applications where humans interact in non-traditional computer environments using gestures. The focus lies on training and assistance applications, where the objective of the training includes implicit knowledge, e.g., motor-skills. On the one hand, these applications require a clear and transparent description of what has to be done during the interaction, while, on the other hand, they are highly interactive and multimodal. Therefore, the human computer interaction becomes modelled from the top down as a collaboration in which each participant pursues their individual goal that is stipulated by a task. In a bottom up processing, gesture recognition determines the actions of the user by applying processing on the continuous data streams from the environment. The resulting gesture or action is interpreted as the user's intention and becomes evaluated during the collaboration, allowing the system to reason about how to best provide guidance at this point. A vertical prototype based on the combination of a haptic virtual environment and a knowledge-based reasoning system is discussed and the evolvement of the task-based collaboration becomes demonstrated.},

  abstract = {Around Device Interaction (ADI) is recently introduced in the field of Human Computer Interaction (HCI)to provide touch less, more intuitive way of interaction using space beyond the physical boundary of the computing devices. In this paper, we introduce a new ADI input device called Pingu in the form factor of a fingering that allows users to interact with any nearby computing device with wireless connectivity in a ubiquitous environment. Fingering form factor is chosen for our prototype design, as it is socially acceptable and is commonly worn in everyday social contexts, and based on the previous research, the information entropy of interaction by fingers is greater than the entropy for any other parts of the human body. The current Pingu prototype is consisted of an extensive set of sensors, visual and vibrot actile feedback mechanisms with wireless connectivity that make it a unique input device for human-computer or human-human interaction in the form of gestures, tactile and touch. Its usage can range from advanced, tiny and novel gestural interaction with a variety of devices to mobile and networked sensing, and social computing. We present a few potential applications of Pingu such as social interaction, context recognition, in-car interaction, and physical activity analysis. View full abstract},

  abstract = {Software support for making effective pen-based applications is currently rudimentary. To facilitate the creation of such applications, we have developed SATIN, a Java-based toolkit designed to support the creation of applications that leverage the informal nature of pens. This support includes a scenegraph for manipulating and rendering objects; support for zooming and rotating objects, switching between multiple views of an object, integration of pen input with interpreters, libraries for manipulating ink strokes, widgets optimized for pens, and compatibility with Javas Swing toolkit. SATIN includes a generalized architecture for handling pen input, consisting of recognizers, interpreters, and multi-interpreters. In this paper, we describe the functionality and architecture of SA TIN, using two applications built with SATIN as examples.},

@article{Lo:2014fo,
  abstract = {Deformable user interfaces leverage the physical actions we use intuitively to interact with real objects. It is therefore important to consider a prototype's physical characteristics when conducting research on deformable interactions. To create an authentic product experience, the authors set out to build a prototype that would mimic potential commercialized flexible devices and achieve the realism often lacking in low-fidelity prototypes. In this article, they outline the design and fabrication process to create Bendy, a prototype for studying deformable user interfaces. Their method creates prototypes quickly (one day) and inexpensively (approximately US 70) by using readily available materials. In addition, the process lets other researchers customize physical properties and interaction language to fit their specific purposes. The deformable prototype is composed of three main layers: a flexible plastic, an array of bend sensors connected to a flexible circuit, and a layer of silicone that encloses the sensors and circuit. The authors describe the fabrication process and demonstrate their method with two additional case studies. This article is part of a special issue on fabrication and printing. The Web extra shows the fabrication process, from the circuit design to printing and testing our flexible circuit, to creating the final Bendy prototype and playing Pac-Man using our deformable prototype.

@article{Healey:1998ea,
  abstract = {StartleCam is a wearable video camera, computer, and sensing system, which enables the camera to be controlled via both conscious and preconscious events involving the wearer. Traditionally, a wearer consciously hits record on the video camera, or runs a computer script to trigger the camera according to some pre-specified frequency. The system described here offers an additional option: images are saved by the system when it detects certain events of supposed interest to the wearer. The implementation described here aims to capture events that are likely to get the user's attention and to be remembered. Attention and memory are highly correlated with what psychologists call arousal level, and the latter is often signaled by skin conductivity changes; consequently, StartleCam monitors the wearer's skin conductivity. StartleCam looks for patterns indicative of a "startle response" in the skin conductivity signal. When this response is detected, a buffer of digital images, recently captured by the wearer's digital camera, is downloaded and optionally transmitted wirelessly to a webserver. This selective storage of digital images creates a "flashbulb" memory archive for the wearable which aims to mimic the wearer. Using a startle detection filter, the StartleCam system has been demonstrated to work on several wearers in both indoor and outdoor ambulatory environments. View full abstract},

In this paper, two types of flexible displacement sensor using the ultrasonic sensor were introduced. One is a built-in displacement sensor for rubber artificial muscle. Another is a sensor that can measure the sliding displacement on a flexible tube for flexible robot. Both sensors use ultrasonic displacement sensors. The construction, operating principle and measuring performance of two sensors were also described.},

However, to provide input to projector phones, users have to look at the device, diverting their attention from the projected image. Additionally, other collocated users have no way of interacting with the device.    We present ShadowPuppets, a system that supports collocated interaction with mobile projector phones. Shadow-Puppets allows users to cast hand shadows as input to mo-bile projector phones. Most people understand how to cast hand shadows, which provide an easy input modality. Additionally, they implicitly support collocated usage, as nearby users can cast shadows as input and one user can see and understand another users hand shadows.    We describe the results of three user studies. The first study examines what hand shadows users expect will cause various effects. The second study looks at how users perceive hand shadows, examining what effects they think various hand shadows will cause. Finally, we present qualitative results from a study with our functional prototype and discuss design implications for systems using shadows as input. Our findings suggest that shadow input can provide a natural and intuitive way of interacting with projected interfaces and can support collocated collaboration.},

  abstract = {Recording and publishing mobile video clips from music  concerts is popular. There is a high potential to increase the  concerts perceived value when producing video remixes  from individual video clips and using them socially. A digital  production of a video remix is an interactive process between  human and computer. However, it is not clear what  the collaboration implications between human and computer  are.    We present a case study where we compare the processes  and products of manual and automatic mobile video remixing.  We provide results from the first systematic real world  study of the subject. We draw our observations from a user  trial where fans recorded mobile video clips during a rock  concert.    The results reveal issues on heterogeneous interests of the  stakeholders, unexpected uses of the raw material, the burden  of editing, diverse quality requirements, motivations for  remixing, the effect of understanding the logic of automation,  and the collaborative use of manual and automatic remixing.},

@article{HamiltonFletcher:2013fo,
  abstract = {Visual sensory substitution devices (SSDs) allow visually-deprived individuals to navigate and recognise the visual world; SSDs also provide opportunities for psychologists to study modality-independent theories of perception. At present most research has focused on encoding greyscale vision. However at the low spatial resolutions received by SSD users, colour information enhances object-ground segmentation, and provides more stable cues for scene and object recognition. Many attempts have been made to encode colour information in tactile or auditory modalities, but many of these studies exist in isolation. This review brings together a wide variety of tactile and auditory approaches to representing colour. We examine how each device constructs colour relative to veridical human colour perception and report previous experiments using these devices. Theoretical approaches to encoding and transferring colour information through sound or touch are discussed for future devices, covering alternative stimulation approaches, perceptually distinct dimensions and intuitive cross-modal correspondences.},

  abstract = {Given the recent explosion of interest in streaming data and online algorithms, clustering of time series subsequences, extracted via a sliding window, has received much attention. In this work we make a surprising claim. Clustering of time series subsequences is meaningless. More concretely, clusters extracted from these time series are forced to obey a certain constraint that is pathologically unlikely to be satisfied by any dataset, and because of this, the clusters extracted by any clustering algorithm are essentially random. While this constraint can be intuitively demonstrated with a simple illustration and is simple to prove, it has never appeared in the literature. We can justify calling our claim surprising, since it invalidates the contribution of dozens of previously published papers. We will justify our claim with a theorem, illustrative examples, and a comprehensive set of experiments on reimplementations of previous work. Although the primary contribution of our work is to draw attention to the fact that an apparent solution to an important problem is incorrect and should no longer be used, we also introduce a novel method which, based on the concept of time series motifs, is able to meaningfully cluster subsequences on some time series datasets.},

@article{Vogel:2007p5564,
  abstract = {Retrieving the stylus of a pen-based device takes time and requires a second hand. Especially for short intermittent interactions many users therefore choose to use their bare fingers. Although convenient, this increases targeting times and error rates. We argue that the main reasons are the occlusion of the target by the user's finger and ambiguity about which part of the finger defines the selection point. We propose a pointing technique we call Shift that is designed to address these issues. When the user touches the screen, Shift creates a callout showing a copy of the occluded screen area and places it in a non-occluded location. The callout also shows a pointer representing the selection point of the finger. Using this visual feedback, users guide the pointer into the target by moving their finger on the screen surface and commit the target acquisition by lifting the finger. Unlike existing techniques, Shift is only invoked when necessary\textendash{}over large targets no callout is created and users enjoy the full performance of an unaltered touch screen. We report the results of a user study showing that with Shift participants can select small targets with much lower error rates than an unaided touch screen and that Shift is faster than Offset Cursor for larger targets.},

Our work combines multiple modalities - gestures, physical selection, location, graphical and voice. In particular, physical selection is obtained by scanning RFID tags associated with the artworks, and tilt gestures are used to control and navigate the user interface and multimedia information. We report on how it has been applied to a mobile museum guide in order to enhance the user experience, providing details on a first user test carried out on our prototype.},

Some remarkable results were obtained during design sessions with novices and experts by engaging them in tangible experiments that were designed to trigger and enhance their skills, tacit knowing and creativity that enable them to represent their ideas and concepts in an intuitive way. We explored the differences in designers behavior during use of analogue and digital representation tools. We will explain our laboratory experiments, test results, educational embedding and creative opportunities that emerge from hybrid design tools. Furthermore we propose an exciting hybrid design tool to bring back the tacit and tangible elements of design processing into CAD systems.},

  abstract = {In this paper, our purpose is to focus on detection of dynamic gestures and find the thresholds to detect gestures for a gesture-based system, DesIRe (DESigning In virtual REality). DesIRe treats virtual reality as a platform of virtual clay and allows realtime dynamic interaction with an object to perform a number of design operations. We developed an interface using a stereoscopic display environment and combining elements of gesture recognition and motion capture. The system architecture of DesIRe include following components: Vizard Virtual Reality Toolkit, an immersive projection system (VISOR), an optical tracking system (specifically the PPT system and the in-house gesture recognition software), and Data Input System (a data glove). In DesIRe, the user has control of a hand-shaped cursor which is guided by a single infrared LED and linked to the data glove finger states and orientation in order to provide an immediate, visual feedback. In this paper, we present an approach to represent the finger states using binary digits in gesture detection and demonstrate the thresholds. We found that thresholds are glove specific.},

  abstract = {Eco-feedback systems currently frame householders as micro-resource managers, who weigh up the costs and benefits of their consumption, and make autonomous, rational and efficient decisions. Reporting on findings from a qualitative study of three Australian energy and water eco-feedback programs utilising an in-home display (IHD) system, this paper challenges this view. The research finds that householders consume energy and water to carry out everyday practices, such as showering, laundering and cooling, which are mediated by social, cultural, technical and institutional dynamics. The paper proposes an alternative design paradigm for eco-feedback systems premised on the realities of everyday life and identifies several design directions that emerge from this new starting point.},

  abstract = {There is growing evidence that low-cost open-source 3-D printers can reduce costs by enabling distributed manufacturing of substitutes for both specialty equipment and conventional mass-manufactured products. The rate of 3-D printable designs under open licenses is growing exponentially and there arealready hundreds of designs applicable to small-scale organic farming. It has also been hypothesized that this technology could assist sustainable development in rural communities that rely on small-scale organic agriculture. To gauge the present utility of open-source 3-D printers in this organic farm context both in the developed and developing world, this paper reviews the current open-source designs available and evaluates the ability of low-cost 3-D printers to be effective at reducing the economic costs of farming.This study limits the evaluation of open-source 3-D printers to only the most-developed fused filament fabrication of the bioplastic polylactic acid (PLA). PLA is a strong biodegradable and recyclable thermoplastic appropriate for a range of representative products, which are grouped into five categories of prints: handtools, food processing, animal management, water management and hydroponics. The advantages and shortcomings of applying 3-D printing to each technology are evaluated. The results show a general izabletechnical viability and economic benefit to adopting open-source 3-D printing for any of the technologies, although the individual economic impact is highly dependent on needs and frequency of use on a specific farm. Capital costs of a 3-D printer may be saved from on-farm printing of a single advanced analytical instrument in a day or replacing hundreds of inexpensive products over a year. In order for the full potential of open-source 3-D printing to be realized to assist organic farm economic resiliency and self-sufficiency, future work is outlined in five core areas: designs of 3-D printable objects, 3-D printing materials, 3-Dprinters, software and 3-D printable repositories.},

A combination of asymmetric (public-key) and symmetric (secret-key) cryptography that allow two parties sharing a common password to exchange confidential and authenticated information over an insecure network is introduced. In particular, a protocol relying on the counter-intuitive motion of using a secret key to encrypt a public key is presented. Such protocols are secure against active attacks, and have the property that the password is protected against offline dictionary attacks},

@inproceedings{Narumi:2011hy,
  abstract = {The main contribution of this paper is to realize computer generated augmented flavors and establish a method to integrate gustatory information into computer human interactions. There are several reasons for the scarcity of research on gustatory information. One reason is that taste sensations are affected by a number of factors, such as vision, olfaction and memories. This produces a complex cognition mechanism for a user's gustatory sensation, and makes it difficult to build up a gustatory display which produces a specific taste on demand.  Our hypothesis is that the complexity of gustatory sensation can be applied to the realization of a "Pseudo-gustatory" display that presents the desired flavors by means of a cross-modal effect elicited by visual and olfactory augmented reality. We propose the Edible Marker system, which can detect the state [number/shape/6-degree-of-freedom (DOF) coordinate] of each piece of bitten or divided food in real time, and the "Pseudo-gustation" method to change the perceived taste of food by changing its appearance and scent. We construct "MetaCookie+" as an implementation and discuss its validity through an exploratory study.},

  abstract = {Mid-air interactions are prone to fatigue and lead to a feeling of heaviness in the upper limbs, a condition casually termed as the gorilla-arm effect. Designers have often associated limitations of their mid-air interactions with arm fatigue, but do not possess a quantitative method to assess and therefore mitigate it. In this paper we propose a novel metric, Consumed Endurance (CE), derived from the biomechanical structure of the upper arm and aimed at characterizing the gorilla-arm effect. We present a method to capture CE in a non-intrusive manner using an off-the-shelf camera-based skeleton tracking system, and demonstrate that CE correlates strongly with the Borg CR10 scale of perceived exertion. We show how designers can use CE as a complementary metric for evaluating existing and designing novel mid-air interactions, including tasks with repetitive input such as mid-air text-entry. Finally, we propose a series of guidelines for the design of fatigue-efficient mid-air interfaces.},

  abstract = {Crowd-sourcing social computing systems represent a new material for HCI designers. However, these systems are difficult to work with and to prototype, because they require a critical mass of participants to investigate social behavior. Service design is an emerging research area that focuses on how customers co-produce the services that they use, and thus it appears to be a great domain to apply this new material. To investigate this relationship, we developed Tiramisu, a transit information system where commuters share GPS traces and submit problem reports. Tiramisu processes incoming traces and generates real-time arrival time predictions for buses. We conducted a field trial with 28 participants. In this paper we report on the results and reflect on the use of field trials to evaluate crowd-sourcing prototypes and on how crowd sourcing can generate co-production between citizens and public services.},

  abstract = {The characteristics of mobile phone usage when user is moving are different from those when user is sedentary or working in an office (Baek et al., 2006). This means that the default vibration frequency of current mobile phones may not be suitable for use in a mobile environment. Therefore, this study was designed to investigate the optimal vibration frequency for the perception of mobile phone vibration when the user is moving. To guarantee the validity of this study, subjects were asked to indicate their perception of the randomly given 10 vibrotactile stimuli while they performed routine activities on a sidewalk, subway, or bus for about 2 h. The results showed that the optimal vibration frequency in the dynamic state was 190 Hz, considerably higher than 151 Hz - the optimal vibration frequency obtained in the static state in the previous study. As a result, mobile phone manufacturers should consider this factor when designing the vibration frequency for the vibration mode so that missed calls in mobile environments are minimized.},

They need to begin paying attention to people and the surrounding situation the way another person would. That way they can begin to adapt their behavior to us, rather than the other way around. We have developed computer systems that can follow people's actions, recognizing their faces, gestures, and expressions. Using this technology we have begun to make smart rooms and smart clothes that can help people in day-to-day life, have the potential to recognize people, understand their speech, allow them to control computer displays without wires or keyboards, communicate by sign language, and warn them they are about to make a mistake View full abstract},

  abstract = {The greatest contributor of CO2 emissions in the average American household is personal transportation. Because transportation is inherently a mobile activity, mobile devices are well suited to sense and provide feedback about these activities. In this paper, we explore the use of personal ambient displays on mobile phones to give users feedback about sensed and self-reported transportation behaviors. We first present results from a set of formative studies exploring our respondents existing transportation routines, willingness to engage in and maintain green transportation behavior, and reactions to early mobile phone green application design concepts. We then describe the results of a 3-week field study (N=13) of the UbiGreen Transportation Display prototype, a mobile phone application that semi-automatically senses and reveals information about transportation behavior. Our contributions include a working system for semiautomatically tracking transit activity, a visual design capable of engaging users in the goal of increasing green transportation, and the results of our studies, which have implications for the design of future green applications.},

  abstract = {The Web provides a corpus of design examples unparalleled in human history. However, leveraging existing designs to produce new pages is often difficult. This paper introduces the Bricolage algorithm for transferring design and content between Web pages. Bricolage employs a novel, structured-prediction technique that learns to create coherent mappings between pages by training on human-generated exemplars. The produced mappings are then used to automatically transfer the content from one page into the style and layout of another. We show that Bricolage can learn to accurately reproduce human page mappings, and that it provides a general, efficient, and automatic technique for retargeting content between a variety of real Web pages.},

@article{Keogh:2004p3291,
  abstract = {Data-driven animation has become the industry standard for computer games and many animated movies and special effects. In particular, motion capture data recorded from live actors, is the most promising approach offered thus far for animating realistic human characters. However, the manipulation of such data for general use and re-use is not yet a solved problem. Many of the existing techniques dealing with editing motion rely on indexing for annotation, segmentation, and re-ordering of the data. Euclidean distance is inappropriate for solving these indexing problems because of the inherent variability found in human motion. The limitations of Euclidean distance stems from the fact that it is very sensitive to distortions in the time axis. A partial solution to this problem, Dynamic Time Warping (DTW), aligns the time axis before calculating the Euclidean distance. However, DTW can only address the problem of local scaling. As we demonstrate in this paper, global or uniform scaling is just as important in the indexing of human motion. We propose a novel technique to speed up similarity search under uniform scaling, based on bounding envelopes. Our technique is intuitive and simple to implement. We describe algorithms that make use of this technique, we perform an experimental analysis with real datasets, and we evaluate it in the context of a motion capture processing system. The results demonstrate the utility of our approach, and show that we can achieve orders of magnitude of speedup over the brute force approach, the only alternative solution currently available.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we present a field study comparing software-based navigation techniques (scrollbars, tap-and-drag, and touch-n-go) on mobile devices. In particular, we were interested in exploring the efficiency and user preference of these navigation techniques for different levels of mobility (sitting, walking, and standing) in a naturalistic environment. Results show that while there was no significant difference in performance between tap-and-drag and touch-n-go, both techniques significantly outperformed scrollbars for simple, multi-directional navigation tasks. In addition, the users preferred the touch-n-go technique over the other two methods. The results also revealed that users' interactions and preferences differed between the levels of mobility.},

In many cases, plurality voting is a part of the combination process. In this article, we discuss and test several well known voting methods from politics and economics on classifier combination in order to see if an alternative to the simple plurality vote exists. We found that, assuming a number of prerequisites, better methods are available, that are comparatively simple and fast.},

A wearable input device that facilitates the use of visual sensors and body sensors is proposed for gesture acquisition. We adapted two different pattern matching techniques, Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) and Hidden Markov Models (HMMs), to support the registration and evaluation of 3D spatial gestures as well as their recognition. One key ingredient of our framework is a concept for the convenient gesture design and registration using HMMs. DTW is used to recognize gestures with a limited training data, and evaluate how the performed gesture is similar to its template gesture. In our experimental evaluation, we designed 18 example gestures and analyzed the performance of recognition methods and gesture features under various conditions. We discuss the variability between users in gesture performance.},

@article{Stern:2006p5100,
  abstract = {A global approach to hand gesture vocabulary design is proposed which includes human as well as technical design factors. The human centered desires of multiple users are implicitly represented through indices obtained from ergonomic studies representing the psychophysiological aspects of users. The main technical aspect considered is that of machine recognition of gestures. We review and classify three approaches to this problem: ad hoc, rule based, and analytical. It is believed that this is the first conceptualization of the optimal hand gesture design problem in analytical form. A mathematical dual objective model is developed, which reflects the psychophysiological and technical performance measures upon which a gesture control system is judged. The mathematical program solves a quadratic assignment problem embedded within a heuristic search tree. The quadratic problem, whose solution is a gesture vocabulary GV, (a command-gesture matching) is solved through simulated annealing. A useful feature, included in the formulation, is the priorities given to the matching of complementary pairs of gestures (say thumb up - thumb down) to complementary pairs of commands (say up - down). To validate the procedure an example is solved for the design of a medium size robot command GV},

@article{Anonymous:2011gl,
  abstract = {Text-based passwords are the most common mechanism for authenticating humans to computer systems. To prevent users from picking passwords that are too easy for an adversary to guess, system administrators adopt password-composition policies (e.g., requiring passwords to contain symbols and numbers). Unfortunately, little is known about the relationship between password-composition policies and the strength of the resulting passwords, or about the behavior of users (e.g., writing down passwords) in response to different policies. We present a large-scale study that investigates password strength, user behavior, and user sentiment across four password-composition policies. We characterize the predictability of passwords by calculating their entropy, and find that a number of commonly held beliefs about password composition and strength are inaccurate. We correlate our results with user behavior and sentiment to produce several recommendations for password-composition policies that result in strong passwords without unduly burdening users.},

  abstract = {This paper describes a tactile probe designed for surface identification in a context of all-terrain low-velocity mobile robotics. The proposed tactile probe is made of a small metallic rod with a single-axis accelerometer attached near its tip. Surface identification is based on analyzing acceleration patterns induced at the tip of this mechanically robust tactile probe, while it is passively dragged along a surface. A training dataset was collected over ten different indoor and outdoor surfaces. Classification results for an artificial neural network were positive, with an 89.9\% and 94.6\% success rate for 1- and 4-s time windows of data, respectively. We also demonstrated that the same tactile probe can be used for unsupervised learning of terrains. For 1-s time windows of data, the classification success rate was only reduced to 74.1\%. Finally, a blind mobile robot, performing real-time classification of surfaces, demonstrated the feasibility of this tactile probe as a guidance mechanism.},

@article{Healey:1999je,
  abstract = {The spectral radiance measured by an airborne imaging spectrometer for a material on the Earth's surface depends strongly on the illumination incident of the material and the atmospheric conditions. This dependence has limited the success of material-identification algorithms that rely on hyperspectral image data without associated ground-truth information. In this paper, the authors use a comprehensive physical model to show that the set of observed 0.4-2.5 {{\&}}mu;m spectral-radiance vectors for a material lies in a low-dimensional subspace of the hyperspectral-measurement space. The physical model captures the dependence of the reflected sunlight, reflected skylight, and path-radiance terms on the scene geometry and on the distribution of atmospheric gases and aerosols over a wide range of conditions. Using the subspace model, they develop a local maximum-likelihood algorithm for automated material identification that is invariant to illumination, atmospheric conditions, and the scene geometry. The algorithm requires only the spectral reflectance of the target material as input. The authors show that the low dimensionality of material subspaces allows for the robust discrimination of a large number of materials over a wide range of conditions. They demonstrate the invariant algorithm for the automated identification of material samples in HYDICE imagery acquired under different illumination and atmospheric conditions},

In this paper, we present a critical analysis of 70 works on this topic spanning the past two decades to understand how we as an academic field talk about sexuality. We use Foucauldian discourse analysis to identify and analyze the various rules of knowledge production on this topic inside our field. By doing so, we expose not only existing gaps in current research literature, but we also gain an understanding of why some of them exist. We suggest some opportunities to make the field more amenable to this kind of research and point out future research directions on sexuality inside the field of HCI.},

To implement this service scenario, we chose to develop a wearable forearm mounted accelerometer based input system. A set of gesture commands was defined by analyzing intuitive forearm movements. A hardware system and software recognition engine that utilizes the accelerometer sensor data to recognize the gesture commands were implemented and tested. This paper describes the development techniques of a wearable gesture recognition system. It also includes discussions of software and hardware design and how variations in these affected gesture recognition rate by analyzing experimental results from the actual implementations.},

@article{Takahashi:1991p704,
  abstract = {It would be ideal for computer-human interaction if a computer could understand human gestures. Hand gestures are one means of interaction between computers and humans[1][2]. A hand gesture interface device, the VPL Data GloveTM, provides real-time information on a user's hand movement[3]. We propose a static hand gesture coding based on experiments and real-time hand gesture recognition method. Taking the 46 gestures of the Japanese kana manual alphabet as examples, we experimented to determine how many static hand configurations can be recognized both with off-line data and with real-time input from a Data GloveTM. In the experiment using off-line data, 23 of the gestures are distinguished and the other 23 figures are placed into 11 groups by coding hand configurations according to joint angles and hand orientation. Real-time hand gesture recognition experiments show that 34 of the 46 hand gestures are recognized correctly.},

@article{Braun:2008dw,
  abstract = {Thematic analysis is a poorly demarcated, rarely acknowledged, yet widely used qualitative analytic method within psychology. In this paper, we argue that it offers an accessible and theoretically flexible approach to analysing qualitative data. We outline what thematic analysis is, locating it in relation to other qualitative analytic methods that search for themes or patterns, and in relation to different epistemological and ontological positions. We then provide clear guidelines to those wanting to start thematic analysis, or conduct it in a more deliberate and rigorous way, and consider potential pitfalls in conducting thematic analysis. Finally, we outline the disadvantages and advantages of thematic analysis. We conclude by advocating thematic analysis as a useful and flexible method for qualitative research in and beyond psychology.},

  abstract = {This work explores a novel interaction paradigm driven by implicit, low-attention user control, accomplished by moni-toring a users physiological state. We have designed and prototyped this interaction for a first use case of bookmarking an audio stream, to holistically explore the implicit interaction concept. Here, a users galvanic skin conductance (GSR) is monitored for orienting responses (ORs) to external interruptions; our prototype automatically bookmarks the media such that the user can attend to the interruption, then resume listening from the point he/she is interrupted. To test this approachs viability, we addressed questions such as: does GSR exhibit a detectable response to interruptions, and how should the interaction utilize this information? In evaluating this system in a controlled environment, we found an OR detection accuracy of 84\%; users provided subjective feedback on its accuracy and utility.},

Only 15\% the volume of MICA2D0T, Eco has the same size as the nonexpandable muPart node but with several times more memory, processing and communication speeds. A separate data aggregator and a development/base-station board enable Eco nodes to form a high-performance body sensor network for pre-term infant monitoring and interactive dance},

  abstract = {Touch sensing and computer vision have made human-computer interaction possible in environments where keyboards, mice, or other handheld implements are not available or desirable. However, the high cost of instrumenting environments limits the ubiquity of these technologies, particularly in home scenarios where cost constraints dominate installation decisions. Fortunately, home environments frequently offer a signal that is unique to locations and objects within the home: electromagnetic noise. In this work, we use the body as a receiving antenna and leverage this noise for gestural interaction. We demonstrate that it is possible to robustly recognize touched locations on an uninstrumented home wall using no specialized sensors. We conduct a series of experiments to explore the capabilities that this new sensing modality may offer. Specifically, we show robust classification of gestures such as the position of discrete touches around light switches, the particular light switch being touched, which appliances are touched, differentiation between hands, as well as continuous proximity of hand to the switch, among others. We close by discussing opportunities, limitations, and future work.},

  abstract = {In this work we contribute to the field of human-machine interaction with a system that anticipates human movements using the concept of Laban Movement Analysis (LMA). The implementation uses a Bayesian model for learning and classification and results are presented for the application to online gesture recognition. The merging of assistive robotics and socially interactive robotics has recently led to the definition of socially assistive robotics. What is necessary and we found still missing are socially interactive robots with a higher level cognitive system which analyzes deeply the observed human movement. In this article we provide a framework for cognitive processes to be implemented in human-machine-interfaces based on nowadays technologies. We present LMA as a concept that helps to identify useful low-level features, defines a framework of mid-level descriptors for movement-properties and helps to develop a classifier of expressive actions. Our interface anticipates a performed action observed from a stream of monocular camera images by using a Bayesian framework. With this work we define the required qualities and characteristics of future embodied agents in terms of social interaction with humans. This article searches for human qualities like anticipation and empathy and presents possible ways towards implementation in the cognitive system of a social robot. We present results through its embodiment in the social robot 'Nicole' in the context of a person performing gestures and 'Nicole' reacting by means of audio output and robot movement.},

To help understand how interfaces can better support a transition to expert performance we develop a framework of the interface and human factors influencing expertise development. We then present a system called Blur that addresses three main problems in promoting the transition: prompting an initial switch to expert techniques, minimising the performance dip arising from the switch, and enabling a high performance ceiling. Blur observes the users interaction with unaltered desktop applications and uses calm notification to support learning and promote awareness of an alternative hot command interface. An empirical study validates Blurs design, demonstrating that users make an early and sustained switch to hot commands, and that doing so improves their performance and satisfaction.},

Most computer-based active reading support seeks to replicate the affordances of paper, but paper has limitations, being in many ways inflexible. In this paper we introduce LiquidText, a computer-based active reading system that takes a fundamentally different approach, offering a flexible, fluid document representation built on multitouch input, with a range of interaction techniques designed to facilitate the activities of active reading. We report here on our design for LiquidText, its interactions and gesture vocabulary, and our design process, including formative user evaluations which helped shape the final system.},

  abstract = {Many surface computing prototypes have employed gestures created by system designers. Although such gestures are appropriate for early investigations, they are not necessarily reflective of user behavior. We present an approach to designing tabletop gestures that relies on eliciting gestures from non-technical users by first portraying the effect of a gesture, and then asking users to perform its cause. In all, 1080 gestures from 20 participants were logged, analyzed, and paired with think-aloud data for 27 commands performed with 1 and 2 hands. Our findings indicate that users rarely care about the number of fingers they employ, that one hand is preferred to two, that desktop idioms strongly influence users mental models, and that some commands elicit little gestural agreement, suggesting the need for on-screen widgets. We also present a complete user-defined gesture set, quantitative agreement scores, implications for surface technology, and a taxonomy of surface gestures. Our results will help designers create better gesture sets informed by user behavior.},

  abstract = {We explore techniques for hand-held devices that leverage the multimodal combination of touch and motion. Hybrid touch + motion gestures exhibit interaction properties that combine the strengths of multi-touch with those of motion-sensing. This affords touch-enhanced motion gestures, such as one-handed zooming by holding ones thumb on the screen while tilting a device. We also consider the reverse perspective, that of motion-enhanced touch, which uses motion sensors to probe what happens underneath the surface of touch. Touching the screen induces secondary accelerations and angular velocities in the sensors. For example, our prototype uses motion sensors to distinguish gently swiping a finger on the screen from drags with a hard onset to enable more expressive touch interactions.},

@article{Kreimeier:2018gy,
  abstract = {With Tangible User Interfaces, the computer user is able to interact in a fundamentally different and more intuitive way than with usual 2D displays. By grasping real physical objects, information can also be conveyed haptically, i.e., the user not only sees information on a 2D display, but can also grasp physical representations. To recognize such objects (tangibles) it is skillful to use capacitive sensing, as it happens in most touch screens. Thus, real objects can be located and identified by the touch screen display automatically. Recent work already addressed such capacitive markers, but focused on their coding scheme and automated fabrication by 3D printing. This paper goes beyond the fabrication by 3D printers and, for the first time, applies the concept of capacitive codes to laser cutting and another immediate prototyping approach using modeling clay. Beside the evaluation of additional properties, we adapt recent research results regarding the optimized detection of tangible objects on capacitive screens. As a result of our comprehensive study, the detection performance is affected by the type of capacitive signal processing (respectively the device) and the geometry of the marker. 3D printing revealed to be the most reliable technique, though laser cutting and immediate prototyping of markers showed promising results. Based on our findings, we discuss individual strengths of each capacitive marker type.},

  abstract = {False positives are a common problem for interfaces that rely on gesture recognition. Often a gesture can seem fine in development but is found to trigger accidentally during an initial deployment of the interface, restarting development and increasing expense. In this work we introduce MAGIC 2.0, a technique for false positive prediction and prevention that can be used interactively during the interface design process. To ground our research, we implement MAGIC 2.0 as a web service and develop gesture interfaces using sensors on common Android mobile phone platforms. We use iSAX (indexable Symbolic Aggregate approXimation) to enable interactive searching (\textexclamdown;2 sec/example) of a large database (\textquestiondown;1,500,000 sec) of everyday user movements on a standard workstation to determine if a candidate gesture will trigger accidentally during use of an interface. We perform a user-independent study that suggests that the number of matches to this Everyday Gesture Library (EGL) database is indeed predictive of a candidate gesture's suitability. We compare iSAX to hidden Markov models (HMMs) and nearest neighbor with respect to accuracy and speed for the EGL search. Using iSAX on the EGL, we also develop a garbage class and show that including this class in recognition reduces errors. View full abstract},

  abstract = {Icons in graphical user interfaces convey information in a mostly universal fashion that allows users to immediately interact with new applications, systems and devices. In this paper, we define Kineticons - an iconographic scheme based on motion. By motion, we mean geometric manipulations applied to a graphical element over time (e.g., scale, rotation, deformation). In contrast to static graphical icons and icons with animated graphics, kineticons do not alter the visual content or pixel-space of an element. Although kineticons are not new \textendash{} indeed, they are seen in several popular systems \textendash{} we formalize their scope and utility. One powerful quality is their ability to be applied to GUI elements of varying size and shape \textendash{} from a something as small as a close button, to something as large as dialog box or even the entire desktop. This allows a suite of system-wide kinetic behaviors to be reused for a variety of uses. Part of our contribution is an initial kineticon vocabulary, which we evaluated in a 200 participant study. We conclude with discussion of our results and design recommendations.},

This paper presents Gestix, a vision-based hand gesture capture and recognition system that interprets in real-time the users gestures for navigation and manipulation of images in an electronic medical record (EMR) database. Navigation and other gestures are translated to commands based on their temporal trajectories, through video capture. Gestix was tested during a brain biopsy procedure. In the in vivo experiment, this interface prevented the surgeons focus shift and change of location while achieving a rapid intuitive reaction and easy interaction. Data from two usability tests provide insights and implications regarding human-computer interaction based on nonverbal conversational modalities.},

In this paper, we introduce four design principles for an everyday hand gesture interface. We evaluate related works and show a prototype that has been designed and developed with these principles in mind. This prototype satisfies most of the principles, and can be easily extended to satisfy all of them when previously announced hardware and software tools hit the market.},

  abstract = {Volunteering is any activity in which time is given freely to benefit another person, group or cause. Volunteering is part of a cluster of helping behaviors, entailing more commitment than spontaneous assistance but narrower in scope than the care provided to family and friends. Although developed somewhat independently, the study of volunteerism and of social activism have much in common. Since data gathering on volunteering from national samples began about a quarter of a century ago, the rate for the United States has been stable or, according to some studies, rising slightly. Theories that explain volunteering by pointing to individual attributes can be grouped into those that emphasize motives or self-understandings on the one hand and those that emphasize rational action and cost-benefit analysis on the other. Other theories seek to complement this focus on individual level factors by pointing to the role of social resources, specifically social ties and organizational activity, as explanations for volunteering. Support is found for all theories, although many issues remained unresolved. Age, gender and race differences in volunteering can be accounted for, in large part, by pointing to differences in self-understandings, human capital, and social resources. Less attention has been paid to contextual effects on volunteering and, while evidence is mixed, the impact of organizational, community, and regional characteristics on individual decisions to volunteer remains a fruitful field for exploration. Studies of the experience of volunteering have only just begun to plot and explain spells of volunteering over the life course and to examine the causes of volunteer turnover. Examining the premise that volunteering is beneficial for the helper as well as the helped, a number of studies have looked at the impact of volunteering on subjective and objective well-being. Positive effects are found for life-satisfaction, self-esteem, self-rated health, and for educational and occupational achievement, functional ability, and mortality. Studies of youth also suggest that volunteering reduces the likelihood of engaging in problem behaviors such as school truancy and drug abuse., No.},

  abstract = {Direct manipulation has had major influence on interface design since it was proposed by Shneiderman in 1982. Although directness generally benefits users, direct manipulation also has weaknesses. In some cases, such as when a user needs to manipulate small, attribute-rich objects or multiple objects simultaneously, indirect manipulation may be more efficient at the cost of directness or intuitiveness of the interaction. Several techniques have been developed over the years to address these issues, but these are all isolated and limited efforts with no coherent underlying principle. We propose the notion of Surrogate Interaction that ties together a large subset of these techniques through the use of a surrogate object that allow users to interact with the surrogate instead of the domain object. We believe that formalizing this family of interaction techniques will provide an additional and powerful interface design alternative for interaction designers, as well as uncover opportunities for future research.},

  abstract = {The recently developed conductive inkjet printing process enables conductive circuits to be created quickly, cheaply, and easily using a consumer-grade inkjet printer. In its basic form, the technique supports a single layer of wiring on a flexible substrate. This can be a valuable tool for pervasive computing research because it allows simple electronic circuits and devices to be built and iterated quickly, in an analogous manner to the use of 3D printers for prototyping mechanical structures. It is possible to rapidly create touch- and proximity-sensitive surfaces, to cut and fold the printed conductive patterns, and to augment them with off-the-shelf electronic components and custom-made subcircuits. The authors present the possibilities enabled by conductive inkjet printing, bringing together their previously published results and presenting their latest insights and findings. They consider these printing and fabrication techniques as a suite of tools for researchers and practitioners who wish to fabricate a variety of functional device prototypes. They aim to enable others to understand the strengths, weaknesses, and applicability of conductive inkjet printing across a range of pervasive computing applications. This article is part of a special issue on printing and fabrication. View full abstract},

Applications of such a system includes quality assurance and estimating surface friction during manipulation tasks. A naive Bayes classifier is used to distinguish textures sensed by a bio-inspired artificial finger. The finger has randomly distributed strain gauges and Polyvinylidene Fluoride (PVDF) films embedded in silicone. Different textures induce different intensity of vibrations in the silicone. Textures can be distinguished by the presence of different frequencies in the signal. The data from the finger is pre-processed and the Fourier coefficients of the sensor outputs are used to learn a classifier for different textures. The performance of the classifier is evaluated against a naive time domain based learner. Preliminary results show that our classifier performs better.},

  abstract = {\textexclamdown{}p\textquestiondown{}The design process used in the development of many products we use daily and the nature of the products themselves are becoming increasingly digital. Although our whole world is turning ever more digital, our bodies and minds are naturally conceived to interact with the physical. Very often, in the design of user-targeted information appliances, the physical and digital processes are formulated separately and usually, due to cost factors, they are only brought together for user testing at the end of the development process. This not only makes major design changes more difficult but it can also significantly affect the users level of acceptance of the product and their experience of use. It is therefore imperative that designers explore the relationship between the physical and the digital form early on in the development process, when one can rapidly work through different sets of ideas. The key to gaining crucial design information from products lies in the construction of meaningful prototypes. This paper specifically examines how physical materials are used during the early design stage and seeks to explore whether the inherent physical properties of these artefacts and the way that designers interpret and manipulate them have a significant impact on the design process. We present the findings of a case study based on information gathered during a design exercise. Detailed analysis of the recordings reveals far more subtle patterns of behaviour than expected. These include the ways in which groups move between abstract and concrete discussions, the way groups comply with or resist the materials they are given, and the complex interactions between the physicality of materials and the group dynamics. This understanding is contributing to ongoing research in the context of our wider agenda of explicating the fundamental role of physicality in the design of hybrid physical and digital artefacts. \textexclamdown/p\textquestiondown{} \textexclamdown{}p\textquestiondown{} \textexclamdown{}strong\textquestiondown{}Keywords:\textexclamdown/strong\textquestiondown{} \textexclamdown{}br /\textquestiondown{} Physicality; Digitality; Product Design; Design Process; Prototyping; Materials\textexclamdown/p\textquestiondown{}},

In this paper, we evaluate three mobile displays: the MicroOptical SV-3, the Sony Libri{\'e}, and the OQO Model 01. These displays each use different underlying technologies and offer unique features which could impact mobile use. The OQO is a hand-held device that utilizes a traditional transflective liquid crystal display (LCD). The MicroOptical SV-3 is a head-mounted display that uses a miniature LCD and offers hands free use. Finally, the Libri{\'e} uses a novel, low power reflective elec tronic ink technology. We present a controlled 15-participant evaluation to assess the effectiveness of using these displays for reading while in motion},

It allows for desktop interactions by moving the device on a planar surface, like a computer mouse. By lifting the device from the surface, users can seamlessly continue handheld interactions in the same application. Since mCube is a single completely wireless device, it can be carried and used for different display platforms. We explore the use of multiple sensors to support a wide range of tasks namely gesture commands, multi-dimensional manipulation and navigation, and tool selections on a pie-menu. This paper addresses the design and implementation of the device with a set of design principles, and demonstrates its exploratory interaction techniques. We also discuss the results of a user evaluation and future directions.},

@article{Lorussi:2005p2168,
  abstract = {In this paper, we report on a new technology used to implement strain sensors to be integrated in usual garments. A particular conductive mixture based on commercial products is realized and directly spread over a piece of fabric, which shows, after the treatment, piezoresistive properties, i.e., a change in resistance when it is strained. This property is exploited to realize sensorized garments such as gloves, leotards, and seat covers capable of reconstructing and monitoring body shape, posture, and gesture. In general, this technology is a good candidate for adherent wearable systems with excellent mechanical coupling with body surface. Here, we mainly focused on a sensorized glove able to detect posture and movements of the fingers. It could be used in several fields of application. We report on experimental results of a sensorized glove used as movements recorder for rehabilitation therapies and medicine. Furthermore, we describe a dedicated methodology used to read the output sensors which allowed to avoid using metallic wires for the connections. The price to be paid for all these advantages is a nonlinear electric response of the fabric sensor and a too long settling time, that in principle, make these sensors not suitable for real-time applications. Here we propose a hardware and computational solution to overcome this limitation},

In this paper we present a computer vision-based gesture interface that is part of an Augmented Reality system. It can recognize a 3D pointing gesture, a click gesture, and five static command gestures. An optimized lookup-table based color segmentation and a fast gesture recognition method are presented that enable for real-time performance (25Hz) on a standard PC.},

A shadow representing the user's thumb touches the screen, presses a button, flicks a cover-flow list, and draws a simple stroke, while the thumb stays and moves on and above the touchpad. In order to implement the concept we developed an optical touchpad for tracking the thumb hovering over its surface, and designed a TV application to demonstrate possible new interaction styles. Throughout two iterations of prototyping, we corrected some of our false expectations, and also verified its potential as a viable option for a TV remote control. This paper presents technical issues and requirements for the hover-tracking touchpad and a complete report of our user studies to explore touch-screen-like interaction for the TV.},

@article{Lampert:2008p3309,
  abstract = {Most successful object recognition systems rely on binary classification, deciding only if an object is present or not, but not providing information on the actual object location. To perform localization, one can take a sliding window approach, but this strongly increases the computational cost, because the classifier function has to be evaluated over a large set of candidate subwindows. In this paper, we propose a simple yet powerful branch-and-bound scheme that allows efficient maximization of a large class of classifier functions over all possible subimages. It converges to a globally optimal solution typically in sublinear time. We show how our method is applicable to different object detection and retrieval scenarios. The achieved speedup allows the use of classifiers for localization that formerly were considered too slow for this task, such as SVMs with a spatial pyramid kernel or nearest neighbor classifiers based on the {$\chi$}2distance. We demonstrate state-of-the-art performance of the resulting systems on the UIUC Cars dataset, the PASCAL VOC 2006 dataset and in the PASCAL VOC 2007 competition.},

  abstract = {The last decade has witnessed a tremendous growths of in terests in applications that deal with querying and min ing time series data. Numerous representation methods for dimensionality reduction and similarity measures geared towards time series have been introduced. Each individ ual work introducing a particular method has made spe cific claims and, aside from the occasional theoretical justi fications, provided quantitative experimental observations. However, for the most part, the comparative aspects of these experiments were too narrowly focused on demonstrating the benefits of the proposed methods over some of the previ ously introduced ones. In order to provide a comprehensive validation, we conducted an extensive set of time series ex periments re-implementing 8 different representation meth ods and 9 similarity measures and their variants, and testing their effectiveness on 38 time series data sets from a wide variety of application domains. In this paper, we give an overview of these different techniques and present our com parative experimental findings regarding their effectiveness. Our experiments have provided both a unified validation of some of the existing achievements, and in some cases, sug gested that certain claims in the literature may be unduly optimistic.},

  abstract = {Pervasive computing has postulated to invisibly integrate technology into everyday objects in such a way, that these objects turn into smart things. Not only a single object of this kind is supposed to represent the interface among the "physical world" of atoms and the "digital world" of bits, but a whole landscapes of them. The interaction with such technology rich artefacts is supposed to be guided by their affordance, i.e. the ability of an artefact to express the modality of its appropriate use. We study human gesticulation and the manipulation of graspable and movable everyday artefacts as a potentially effective means for the interaction with smart things. In this work we consider gestures in the general sense of a movement or a state (posture) of the human body, as well as a movement or state of any physical object resulting from human manipulation. Intuitive "everyday"-gestures have been collected in a series of user tests, yielding a catalogue of generic body and artefact gesture dynamics. Atomic gestures are described by trajectories of orientation data, while composite gestures are defined by a compositional gesture grammar. The respective mechanisms for the recognition of such gestures have been implemented in a general software framework supported by an accelerometer-based sensing system. Showcases involving multiple gesture sensors demonstrate the viability of implicit embedded interaction for real life scenarios},

  abstract = {Wearable computing, where users can wear computers anywhere and at any time, is slowly becoming a reality because of recent technological advancements. When users access various services in wearable computing environments, they want to define new services by themselves. Therefore, we propose a new framework for constructing context-aware applications in wearable computing environments. Our framework, called Wearable Toolkit, consists of an event-driven rule processing engine and tools to develop applications. By using our framework, we can define and customise services anywhere and at any time. We found our system helps to create context-aware wearable services from the results we obtained by evaluating it.},

We use a tracked probe to sample the objects' geometries, and we acquire video images from the head-mounted cameras to capture textures. Our system provides visual feedback during modeling by overlaying the model onto the real object in the user's field of view. This visual feedback makes the modeling process interactive and intuitive.},

@article{Ullman:1988dw,
  abstract = {This paper describes the task/episode accumulation model (TEA model) of non-routine mechanical design, which was developed after detailed analysis of the audio and video protocols of five mechanical designers. The model is able to explain the behavior of designers at a much finer level of detail than previous models. The key features of the model are (a) the design is constructed by incrementally refining and patching an initial conceptual design, (b) design alternatives are not considered outside the boundaries of design episodes (which are short stretches of problem solving aimed at specific goals), (c) the design process is controlled locally, primarily at the level of individual episodes. Among the implications of the model are the following: (a) CAD tools should be extended to represent the state of the design at more abstract levels, (b) CAD tools should help the designer manage constraints, and (c) CAD tools should be designed to give cognitive support to the designer.},

  abstract = {Acquiring small targets on a tablet or touch screen can be challenging. To address the problem, researchers have proposed techniques that enlarge the effective size of targets by extending targets into adjacent screen space. When applied to targets organized in clusters, however, these techniques show little effect because there is no space to grow into. Unfortunately, target clusters are common in many popular applications. We present Starburst, a space partitioning algorithm that works for target clusters. Starburst identifies areas of available screen space, grows a line from each target into the available space, and then expands that line into a clickable surface. We present the basic algorithm and extensions. We then present 2 user studies in which Starburst led to a reduction in error rate by factors of 9 and 3 compared to traditional target expansion.},

One key element of our concept of a future smart control room is a movable multi-touch table called Affordance table. In this paper we present the results of a user test in which we explored what kind of hand gestures are intuitive and comfortable when using multi-touch sensitive displays. Overall, simple gestures were preferred over more complex ones, and dimensions of gestures such as duration, force and direction have an impact on participants evaluations. Some gestures also evoked similar associations among the participants. Our results suggest that user preferences and associations should be carefully considered when mapping gestures to system commands.},

With this goal in mind, two questions can be examined: 1) have we achieved the goals we set out? and 2) how has the direction of research changed in the past fifteen years?

@article{VazquezAlvarez:2011fn,
  abstract = {As mobile devices increase in functionality, users perform more tasks when on the move. Spatial audio interfaces offer a solution for eyes-free interaction. However, such interfaces face a number of challenges when supporting multiple and simultaneous tasks, namely: 1) interference amongst multiple audio streams, and 2) the constraints of cognitive load. We present a comparative study of spatial audio techniques evaluated in a divided- and selective-attention task. A podcast was used for high cognitive load (divided-attention) and classical music for low cognitive load (selective-attention), while interacting with an audio menu. Results showed that spatial audio techniques were preferred when cognitive load was kept low, while a baseline technique using an interruptible single audio stream was significantly less preferred. Conversely, when cognitive load was increased the preferences reversed. Thus, given an appropriate task structure, spatial techniques offer a means of designing effective audio interfaces to support eyes-free mobile multitasking.},

With audio feedback, spatial audio display elements are found to enable usable deictic interac-tion that can be described using Fitts law. Feedback does not affect perceived workload or preferred walking speed compared to interaction without feedback. Mobility is found to degrade interaction speed and accuracy by 20\%. Participants were able to perform deictic spatial audio target acquisition when mobile while walking at 73\% of their pre-ferred walking speed. The proposed feedback design is ex-amined in detail and the effects of variable target widths are quantified. Deictic interaction with a spatial audio display is found to be a feasible solution for future interface designs.},

  abstract = {Fast and accurate recognition of motion data streams from gesture sensing and motion capture devices has many applications and is the focus of this article. Based on the analysis of the geometric structures revealed by singular value decompositions (SVD) of motion data, a similarity measure is proposed for simultaneously segmenting and recognizing motion streams. A direction identification approach is explored to further differentiate motions with similar data geometric structures. Experiments show that the proposed similarity measure can segment and recognize motion streams of variable lengths with high accuracy, without knowing beforehand the number of motions in a stream.},

  abstract = {We extend soft lithography microfabrication and design methods to introduce curvature sensors that are elastically soft (modulus 0.1\textendash{}1 MPa) and stretchable (100\textendash{}1000\% strain). In contrast to existing curvature sensors that measure differential strain, sensors in this new class measure curvature directly and allow for arbitrary gauge factor and film thickness. Moreover, each sensor is composed entirely of a soft elastomer (PDMS (polydimethylsiloxane) or Ecoflex\textregistered{}) and conductive liquid (eutectic gallium indium, eGaIn) and thus remains functional even when stretched to several times its natural length. The electrical resistance in the embedded eGaIn microchannel is measured as a function of the bending curvature for a variety of sensor designs. In all cases, the experimental measurements are in reasonable agreement with closed-form algebraic approximations derived from elastic plate theory and Ohm's law.},

@article{Anonymous:2011bk,
  abstract = {Large-scale, ground-level urban imagery has recently developed as an important element of online mapping tools such as Google's Street View. Such imagery is extremely valuable in a number of potential applications, ranging from augmented reality to 3D modeling, and from urban planning to monitoring city infrastructure. While such imagery is already available from many sources, including Street View and tourist photos on photo-sharing sites, these collections have drawbacks related to high cost, incompleteness, and accuracy. A potential solution is to leverage the community of photographers around the world to collaboratively acquire large-scale image collections. This work explores this approach through PhotoCity, an online game that trains its players to become ``experts'' at taking photos at targeted locations and in great density, for the purposes of creating 3D building models. To evaluate our approach, we ran a competition between two universities that resulted in the submission of over 100,000 photos, many of which were highly relevant for the 3D modeling task at hand. Although the number of players was small, we found that this was compensated for by incentives that drove players to become experts at photo collection, often capturing thousands of useful photos each.},

Yet restoration\textemdash{}the process of returning something to a previous condition, often regardless of its instrumental value\textemdash{}is a relatively rare practice with computational technologies. The aim of this paper is to enrich HCI design practices by considering the material qualities of restoration. We consider what makes a technology worth restoring and what constitutes the process of restoration by examining data collected from a three-month apprenticeship-based qualitative study of bookbinding. Building on relevant literatures, we offer antiquarian books\textemdash{}long-established information technologies\textemdash{}as a lens onto the ways values are enacted through material engagements. We conclude with a discussion of restorations role in HCI.},

  abstract = {This paper provides an overview of a multi-modal wearable computer system, SNAP{{\&}}TELL. The system performs real-time gesture tracking, combined with audio-based control commands, in order to recognize objects in an environment, including outdoor landmarks. The system uses a single camera to capture images, which are then processed to perform color segmentation, fingertip shape analysis, robust tracking, and invariant object recognition, in order to quickly identify the objects encircled and SNAPped by the users pointing gesture. In addition, the system returns an audio narration, TELLing the user information concerning the objects classification, historical facts, usage, etc. This system provides enabling technology for the design of intelligent assistants to support Web-On-The-World applications, with potential uses such as travel assistance, business advertisement, the design of smart living and working spaces, and pervasive wireless services and internet vehicles.},

  abstract = {Experimental methods have been under criticism since the advent of mobile and ubiquitous technologies, due to clear limitations in their suitability for studies in the field. However, the laboratory paradigm cannot be directly transferred to field conditions because of its strict notions of experimentation. This chapter examines the theory of quasi-experimentation as an alternative conceptualization of causality, control, and validity. Several threats to experimental validity in field experiments in HCI are discussed. These concerns must be addressed at all levels of experimentation, from the design and execution of a field experiment to analysis of data. Noteworthy also are new technical solutions that have enabled high-fidelity data collection and that generally support endeavors in ensuring validity. If field experimentation is to become the de facto standard of research in human\textendash{}computer interaction, the methodological core and technical tools must be developed in concert.},

  abstract = {Tabletop computers based on diffuse illumination can track fiducial markers placed on the tables surface. In this paper, we demonstrate how to do the same with objects arranged in a three-dimensional structure without modifying the table. We present lumino, a system of building blocks. In addition to a marker, each block contains a glass fiber bundle. The bundle optically guides the light reflected off markers in the higher levels down to the table surface, where the tables built-in camera reads it. While guiding marker images down, the bundle optically scales and rearranges them. It thereby fits the images of an entire vertical arrangement of markers into the horizontal space usually occupied by a single 2D marker. We present six classes of blocks and matching marker designs, each of which is optimized for different requirements. We show three demo applications. One of them is a construction kit that logs and critiques constructions. The presented blocks are unpowered and maintenance-free, keeping larger numbers of blocks manageable.},

@article{Rogers:2011bk,
  abstract = {Vibrotactile feedback offers much potential for facilitating and accelerating how people learn sensory-motor skills that typically take hundreds of hours to learn, such as learning to play a musical instrument, skiing or swimming. However, there is little evidence of this benefit materializing outside of research lab settings. We describe the findings of an in-the-wild study that explored how to integrate vibrotactile feedback into a real-world teaching setting. The focus of the study was on exploring how children of different ages, learning to play the violin, can use real-time vibrotactile feedback. Many of the findings were unexpected, showing how students and their teachers appropriated the technology in creative ways. We present some lessons learned that are also applicable to other training settings, emphasizing the need to understand how vibrotactile feedback can switch between being foregrounded and backgrounded depending on the demands of the task, the teachers role in making it work and when feedback is most relevant and useful. Finally, we discuss how vibrotactile feedback can provide a new language for talking about the skill being learned that may also play an instrumental role in enhancing learning.},

@article{Ratanamahatana:2004p30,
  abstract = {The Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) distance measure is a technique that has long been known in speech recognition community. It allows a non-linear mapping of one signal to another by minimizing the distance between the two. A decade ago, DTW was introduced into Data Mining community as a utility for various tasks for time series problems including classification, clustering, and anomaly detection. The technique has flourished, particularly in the last three years, and has been applied to a variety of problems in various disciplines. In spite of DTWs great success, there are still several persistent myths about it. These myths have caused confusion and led to much wasted research effort. In this work, we will dispel these myths with the most comprehensive set of time series experiments ever conducted.},

However, these techniques introduce a search or decision component to pointing -\textendash{} users must examine the alternatives available and decide upon the trajectory to use. We analyse these difficulties, present a methodology for examining them as well as other behaviour issues, and report empirical results of performance with pointer wrapping and Ninja cursors. Results show that offering multiple trajectories incurs a significant search or decision cost, and that users are therefore poor at capitalising on the theoretical benefits of reduced target distance.},

  abstract = {This paper explores the interactive possibilities enabled when the barrel of a digital pen is augmented with a multi-touch sensor. We present a novel multi-touch pen (MTPen) prototype and discuss its alternate uses beyond those of a standard stylus, such as allowing new touch gestures to be performed using the index finger or thumb and detecting how users grip the device as a mechanism for mode switching. We also discuss the hardware and software implementation challenges in realizing our prototype, and showcase how one can combine different grips (tripod, relaxed tripod, sketch, wrap) and gestures (swipe and double tap) to enable new interaction techniques with the MTPen in a prototype drawing application. One specific aim is the elimination of some of the comfort problems associated with existing auxiliary controls on digital pens, such as barrel buttons and barrel scroll wheels; such mechanical controls work best in only a few specific hand grips and pen rotations. Comparatively, our gestures can be successfully and comfortably performed regardless of the rotation of the pen or how the user grips it, offering greater flexibility in use. We describe a formal evaluation comparing MTPen gestures against the use of a barrel button for mode switching. This study shows that both swipe and double tap gestures are comparable in performance to commonly employed barrel buttons without its disadvantages.},

To enrich that vocabulary we propose to discriminate, among thumb gestures, those we call MicroRolls, characterized by zero tangential velocity of the skin relative to the screen surface. Combining four categories of thumb gestures, Drags, Swipes, Rubbings and MicroRolls, with other classification dimensions, we show that at least 16 elemental gestures can be automatically recognized. We also report the results of two experiments showing that the roll vs. slide distinction facilitates thumb input in a realistic copy and paste task, relative to existing interaction techniques.},

The specific inner workings of WearCam, in particular; details of its optical arrangement, have not previously been disclosed, other than by allowing a small number of individuals to look inside the glasses. General considerations, background, and relevant findings, in the area of long-term use of wearable, tetherless computer-mediated reality are also presented. Some general insight (arising from having designed and built more than 100 different kinds of personal imaging systems over the last 20 years) is also provided. Unlike the artificiality of many controlled laboratory experiments, much of the insight gained from these experiences relates to the natural complexity of real-life situations. View full abstract},

  abstract = {Multimodal User Interaction (MMUI) technology aims at building natural and intuitive interfaces allowing a user to interact with computer in a way similar to human-to-human communication, for example, through speech and gestures. As a critical component in MMUI, Multimodal Input Fusion explores ways to effectively interpret the combined semantic interpretation of user inputs through multiple modalities. This paper presents a novel approach to multi-sensory data fusion based on speech and manual deictic gesture inputs. The effectiveness of the technique has been validated through experiments, using a traffic incident management scenario where an operator interacts with a map on a large display at a distance and issues multimodal commands through speech and manual gestures. The description of the proposed approach and preliminary experiment results are presented.},

  abstract = {Direct-touch interaction on mobile phones revolves around screens that compete for visual attention with users real-world tasks and activities. This paper investigates the impact of these situational impairments on touch-screen interaction. We probe several design factors for touch-screen gestures, under various levels of environmental demands on attention, in comparison to the status-quo approach of soft buttons. We find that in the presence of environmental distractions, gestures can offer significant performance gains and reduced attentional load, while performing as well as soft buttons when the users attention is focused on the phone. In fact, the speed and accuracy of bezel gestures did not appear to be significantly affected by environment, and some gestures could be articulated eyes-free, with one hand. Bezel-initiated gestures offered the fastest performance, and mark-based gestures were the most accurate. Bezel-initiated marks therefore may offer a promising approach for mobile touch-screen interaction that is less demanding of the users attention.},

@article{Landay:1996p1437,
  abstract = {Current interactive user interface construction tools are often more of a hindrance than a benefit during the early stages of interface design. These tools take too much time to use and force designers to specify more of the design details than they wish at this stage. Most designers prefer to sketch early interface ideas on paper. I have developed an interactive tool called SILK that allows designers to quickly sketch an interface using an electronic pad and stylus. SILK preserves the important properties of pencil and paper: a rough drawing can be produced very quickly and the medium is very flexible, However, unlike a paper sketch, this electronic sketch is interactive. The designer can illustrate behaviors by sketching storyboards, which specify how the screen should change in response to end-user actions. In addition, it can be semi-automatically transformed into a complete, operational interface in a specified look-and-feel.},

The simplest packing problem is rectangular packing, where both the objects and the region are rectangular. Many research works have been done on two and three dimensional rectangular packing. However, there are many situations when either objects or the containing region is irregular in shape. In the project, we concentrate on two-dimensional packing problems involving irregular shaped objects (both convex and concave). We have applied several approaches to solve such problems.

We use non- manifold surface meshes to define complex objects, which can have multiple connected solid regions of different materials. Our suite of tools can create and edit non-manifold surfaces, while maintaining a consistent labeling of distinct regions. We also introduce a technique for generating approximate material gradients, using a set of thin layers with varying material properties. We demonstrate our approaches by printing physical objects \ldots{}},

Push-and-Pull Switching enables switching between groups and restacking the focused window to any position to change its group membership. The technique was evaluated in an experiment which found that Push-and-Pull Switching improves switching performance by more than 50\% compared to other switching techniques in different scenarios. A longitudinal user study indicates that participants invoked this switching technique 15\% of the time on single monitor displays and that they found it easy to understand and use.},

  abstract = {Everyday activities often involve using an interactive device while one is handling various other physical objects (wallets, bags, doors, pens, mugs, etc.). This paper presents the Manual Multitasking Test, a test with 12 conditions emulating manual demands of everyday multitasking situations. It allows experimenters to expose the effects of design on "manual flexibility": users ability to reconfigure the sensorimotor control of arms, hands, and fingers in order to regain the high performance levels they experience when using the device on its own. The test was deployed for pointing devices on laptops and Qwerty keyboards of mobile devices. In these studies, we identified facilitative design features whose absence explains, for example, why the mouse and stylus function poorly in multi-object performance. The issue deserves more attention, because interfaces that are nominally similar (e.g., "one-handed input") can vary dramatically in terms of "ease of juggling."},

@article{Varma:hg,
  abstract = {In this paper, we investigate material classification from single images obtained under unknown viewpoint and illumination. It is demonstrated that materials can be classified using the joint distribution of intensity values over extremely compact neighborhoods (starting from as small as 3times3 pixels square) and that this can outperform classification using filter banks with large support. It is also shown that the performance of filter banks is inferior to that of image patches with equivalent neighborhoods. We develop novel texton-based representations which are suited to modeling this joint neighborhood distribution for Markov random fields. The representations are learned from training images and then used to classify novel images (with unknown viewpoint and lighting) into texture classes. Three such representations are proposed and their performance is assessed and compared to that of filter banks. The power of the method is demonstrated by classifying 2,806 images of all 61 materials present in the Columbia-Utrecht database. The classification performance surpasses that of recent state-of-the-art filter bank-based classifiers such as Leung and Malik (IJCV 01), Cula and Dana (IJCV 04), and Varma and Zisserman (IJCV 05). We also benchmark performance by classifying all of the textures present in the UIUC, Microsoft Textile, and San Francisco outdoor data sets. We conclude with discussions on why features based on compact neighborhoods can correctly discriminate between textures with large global structure and why the performance of filter banks is not superior to that of the source image patches from which they were derived.},

  abstract = {This article introduces the OrthoZoom Scroller, a novel interaction technique that improves target acquisition in very large one-dimensional spaces. The OrthoZoom Scroller requires only a mouse to perform panning and zooming in a 1D space. Panning is performed along the slider dimension while zooming is performed along the orthogonal one. We present a controlled experiment showing that the OrthoZoom Scroller is about twice as fast as Speed Dependant Automatic Zooming to perform pointing tasks whose index of difficulty is in the 10-30 bits range. We also present an application to browse large textual documents with the OrthoZoom Scroller that uses semantic zooming and snapping on the structure.},

A prototype biopotential sensor node has been designed for monitoring a multitude of biopotential signals. A system consisting of three of these nodes packaged in a headband enables wireless sleep stage monitoring. Preliminary results obtained from a one-night test on a healthy patient suggest that the proposed system is suitable for sleep staging applications. By removing most of the wires, the proposed system improves the patient's comfort and the quality of the signals during sleep studies. It paves the way towards remote sleep monitoring and telemedicine applications.},

  abstract = {Model-based activity recognition has been recently proposed as an alternative to signal-oriented recognition. Such model-based approaches seem attractive due to their ability to enable user-independent activity recognition and due to their improved robustness to signal-variation. The first goal of this paper is therefore to systematically analyze the benefit of body-model derived primitives in different sensor settings for multi activity recognition. Furthermore we propose a new body-model based approach using accelerometer sensors only thereby reducing the sensor requirements significantly. Results on a 20 activity dataset indicate that body-model based approaches consistently improve results over signal-oriented approaches. View full abstract},

  abstract = {Previous research shows that text entry by gaze using dwell time is slow, about 5-10 words per minute (wpm). These results are based on experiments with novices using a constant dwell time, typically between 450 and 1000 ms. We conducted a longitudinal study to find out how fast novices learn to type by gaze using an adjustable dwell time. Our results show that the text entry rate increased from 6.9 wpm in the first session to 19.9 wpm in the tenth session. Correspondingly, the dwell time decreased from an average of 876 ms to 282 ms, and the error rates decreased from 1.28\% to .36\%. The achieved typing speed of nearly 20 wpm is comparable with the result of 17.3 wpm achieved in an earlier, similar study with Dasher.},

  abstract = {3D printing technology can produce complex objects directly from computer aided digital designs. The technology has traditionally been used by large companies to produce fit and form concept prototypes (rapid prototyping) before production. In recent years however there has been a move to adopt the technology as full-scale manufacturing solution. The advent of low-cost, desktop 3D printers such as the RepRap and Fab@Home has meant a wider user base are now able to have access to desktop manufacturing platforms enabling them to produce highly customised products for personal use and sale. This uptake in usage has been coupled with a demand for printing technology and materials able to print functional elements such as electronic sensors. Here we present formulation of a simple conductive thermoplastic composite we term carbomorph and demonstrate how it can be used in an unmodified low-cost 3D printer to print electronic sensors able to sense mechanical flexing and capacitance changes. We show how this capability can be used to produce custom sensing devices and user interface devices along with printed objects with embedded sensing capability. This advance in low-cost 3D printing with offer a new paradigm in the 3D printing field with printed sensors and electronics embedded inside 3D printed objects in a single build process without requiring complex or expensive materials incorporating additives such as carbon nanotubes.},

  abstract = {Finger-based touch input has become a major interaction modality for mobile user interfaces. However, due to the low precision of finger input, small user interface components are often difficult to acquire and operate on a mobile device. It is even harder when the user is on the go and unable to pay close attention to the interface. In this paper, we present Gesture Avatar, a novel interaction technique that allows users to operate existing arbitrary user interfaces using gestures. It leverages the visibility of graphical user interfaces and the casual interaction of gestures. Gesture Avatar can be used to enhance a range of mobile interactions. A user study we conducted showed that compared to Shift (an alternative technique for target acquisition tasks), Gesture Avatar performed at a much lower error rate on various target sizes and significantly faster on small targets (1mm). It also showed that using Gesture Avatar while walking did not significantly impact its performance, which makes it suitable for mobile uses.},

The Model Driven Engineering (MDE) approach, which was used for user interface generation since the early eighties in HCI, has recently been revived to address this complex problem. Although MDE has resulted in interesting and convincing results for conventional WIMP user interfaces, it has not fully demonstrated its theoretical promises yet. In this paper, we discuss how to push MDE to the limit in order to reconcile high-level modeling techniques with low-level programming in order to go beyond WIMP user interfaces.},

  abstract = {Mobile devices are generally used in public, where the user is surrounded by others not involved in the interaction. Audible notification cues are often a cause of unnecessary disruption and distraction both for co-located people and even for the user to whom they are directed. We present a wearable peripheral display embedded in eyeglasses that delivers subtle, discreet and unobtrusive cues. The display is personal and intimate; it delivers visual cues in the wearers periphery without disrupting their immediate environment. A user study conducted to validate the design reveals that the display is effective and subtle in notifying users. Experimental results show, with significance, that the cues can be designed to meet specific levels of visibility and disruption for the wearer, so that some cues are less noticeable when the user is not under high workload, which is highly desirable in many practical circumstances. Hence, peripheral notification displays can provide an effective solution for designing socially acceptable notification displays, unobtrusive to the user and the immediate environment.},

@article{Carreira:2006p1270,
  abstract = {This paper proposes a new approach to shape classification that is well suited to the specific challenges of vision-based hand posture recognition in a multi-user tabletop collaboration scenario. We use a representation of the 2-D hand silhouette where in-plane rotation and mirror symmetry appear as particular cases of permutations, and then show how to take advantage of this pattern to develop an efficient version of the permutation invariant SVM. Invariance to these transformations is very important because the users stand around the table, and a video camera captures the scene from the top. We also report experimental results that compare this approach favorably over common classification approaches, under the stated requirements.},

The final operating version was rested in Shannon's basement home lab in June of 1961. The cigarette pack sized analog device yielded an expected gain of +44\% when betting on the most favored "octant". The Shannons and Thorps tested the computer in Las Vegas in the summer of 1961. The predictions there were consistent with the laboratory expected gain of 44\% but a minor hardware problem deferred sustained serious betting. We kept the method and the existence of the computer secret until 1966. View full abstract},

  abstract = {Many tasks in graphical user interfaces require users to interact with elements at various levels of precision. We present FingerGlass, a bimanual technique designed to improve the precision of graphical tasks on multitouch screens. It enables users to quickly navigate to different locations and across multiple scales of a scene using a single hand. The other hand can simultaneously interact with objects in the scene. Unlike traditional pan-zoom interfaces, FingerGlass retains contextual information during the interaction. We evaluated our technique in the context of precise object selection and translation and found that FingerGlass significantly outperforms three state-of-the-art baseline techniques in both objective and subjective measurements: users acquired and translated targets more than 50\% faster than with the second-best technique in our experiment.},

The shape of metamolds is designed through a novel segmentation technique, which takes into account both geometric and topological constraints involved in the process of mold casting.

  abstract = {Fluidic no-moving-part oscillators generating pulsation in fluid flow became recently a very popular subject of investigations. The reason is their capability to increase efficiency of various chemical and physico/chemical processes. Also control of flows past bodies is more effective with the pulsation. Advantages of fluidic oscillators used for the task are low cost, robustness, long life, no maintenance, and other similar factors associated with absence of mechanical components. New oscillator principles - as well as old, nearly forgotten and now re-discovered - are currently developed. Sheer number of possible alternatives makes them difficult to survey. This paper attempts at clarifying the situation.},

We studied moves in 548 interdisciplinary research projects with 2691 researchers (PIs). Moves, and thus disruptions, were not rare, especially in large distributed projects. Overall, one-third of all projects experienced at least one member relocating but most moves reflected churn across high-ranking institutions. When collaborators moved, the project was disrupted. Our data suggest that moves exemplify normal disruptions. A design challenge is to help projects adapt to disruption.},

  abstract = {We propose a new tactile device which measures multi-DOF vibrations exerted on the proximal phalanx. In this paper, two kinds of applications for the device are discussed. One application is virtual buttons assigned on a finger. The idea is to estimate the location of contact on the users finger by utilizing the features of multi-DOF vibrations measured at the root of the finger. The other application is to use the finger ring device as a pointing device. Our strategy for obtaining the position of the finger from the output of the accelerometer is to integrate the acceleration only when the finger is being rubbed on the textured surface to avoid error accumulation. As an experiment for virtual buttons, the accelerations were exerted by tapping the distal and middle phalanx and the features of the obtained accelerations were examined. A preliminary experiment for the pointing device is also discussed.},

  abstract = {With widespread broadband adoption, more households report experiencing sub-optimal speeds. Not only are slow speeds frustrating, they may indicate consumers are not receiving the services they are paying for from their internet service providers. Yet, determining the speed and source of slow-downs is hard because few tools exist for broadband management. We report on results of a field trial with 10 households using a visual network probe designed to address these problems. We describe the results of the study and provide design implications for future tools. More importantly, we argue that tools like this can educate and empower consumers by making broadband speeds and sources of slow-downs more visible.},

  abstract = {While strings and syntax trees are used by the Natural Language Processing community to represent the structure of spoken languages, these encodings are difficult to adapt to a signed language like American Sign Language (ASL). In particular, the multichannel nature of an ASL performance makes it difficult to encode in a linear single-channel string. This paper will introduce the Partition/Constitute (P/C) Formalism, a new method of computationally representing a linguistic signal containing multiple channels. The formalism allows coordination and non-coordination relationships to be encoded between different portions of a signal. The P/C formalism will be compared to representations used in related research in gesture animation. The way in which P/C is used by this project to build an English-to-ASL machine translation system will also be discussed.},

Using a wearable in the field without having a negative effect on the user is a significant and interesting challenge that is shared by many application areas of wearable technologies. In this work we identify 'minimal interface' requirements, and present ideas, such as the use of pie menus, to try and develop a simple interface that can be used with only three buttons, enhancing and reducing the burden on limited communication channels.},

@article{Anonymous:2011dw,
  abstract = {Part of being a parent is taking responsibility for arranging and supplying transportation of children between various events. Dual-income parents frequently develop routines to help manage transportation with a minimal amount of attention. On days when families deviate from their routines, effective logistics can often depend on knowledge of the routine location, availability and intentions of other family members. Since most families rarely document their routine activities, making that needed information unavailable, coordination breakdowns are much more likely to occur. To address this problem we demonstrate the feasibility of learning family routines using mobile phone GPS. We describe how we (1) detect pick-ups and drop-offs; (2) predict which parent will perform a future pick-up or drop-off; and (3) infer if a child will be left at an activity. We discuss how these routine models give digital calendars, reminder and location systems new capabilities to help prevent breakdowns, and improve family life.},

  abstract = {Emerging pervasive computing technologies present many opportunities to aid ad-hoc collocated group collaboration. To better understand ad-hoc collaboration using pervasive technologies, or Pervasive Collaboration, a design space composed of three axes (composition granularity, sharing models, and resource references) is outlined, highlighting areas that are only partially covered by existing systems. Addressing some of these gaps, Platform Composition is a technique designed to overcome the usability limitations of small mobile devices and facilitate group activities in ad-hoc environments by enabling users to run legacy applications on a collection mobile devices. The associated Composition Framework prototype demonstrates a concrete implementation that explores the applicability of existing technologies, protocols, and applications to this model. Overall, Platform Composition promises to be an effective technique for supporting collaborative work on mobile devices, without requiring significant changes to the underlying computer platform or enduser applications.},

Advancements in computer-aided design programs and three-dimensional printing offer the possibility of designing and manufacturing transitional prostheses at very low cost. The aim of this project was to describe an inexpensive three-dimensional printed mechanical shoulder prosthesis to assist a pre-selected subject in performing bi-manual activities.Technique:The main function of the body-powered, manually adjusted three-dimensional printed shoulder prosthesis is to provide a cost-effective, highly customized transitional device to individuals with congenital or acquired forequarter amputations.Discussion:After testing the prototype on a young research participant, a partial correction of the patients spinal deviation was noted due to the counterweight of the device. The patients family also reported improved balance and performance of some bimanual activities after 2 weeks of using the device. Limitations of th...},

  abstract = {This study explored the feasibility of displaying dynamic Chinese text on the screen of a wrist watch. Three design factors (i.e., dynamic display, presentation method, and speed) were examined to investigate their effects on users' reading comprehension under two different conditions of task types. The results of this study indicated the following: (1) There was no significant difference between leading display and RSVP in both single- and dual-task conditions; (2) Presentation method was a significant factor. The participant's reading comprehension was significantly better with the word-by-word format than with the character-by-character one in both single- and dual-task conditions; (3) The participant's reading comprehension was not significantly different among the three different speed settings in the single-task condition. However, participants had significantly higher reading comprehension scores under the slower speed settings of 150 and 250 cpm than under the faster speed setting of 350 cpm in the dual-task condition.},

@article{Lee:1961ie,
  abstract = {The algorithm described in this paper is the outcome of an endeavor to answer the following question: Is it possible to find procedures which would enable a computer to solve efficiently path-connection problems inherent in logical drawing, wiring diagramming, and optimal route finding? The results are highly encouraging. Within our framework, we are able to solve the following types of problems: 1) To find a path between two points so that it crosses the least number of existing paths. 2) To find a path between two points so that it avoids as much as possible preset obstacles such as edges. 3) To find a path between two points so that the path is optimal with respect to several properties; for example, a path which is not only one of those which cross the fewest number of existing paths, but, among these, is also one of the shortest. The minimal-distance solution has been programmed on an IBM 704 computer, and a number of illustrations are presented. The class of problems solvable by our algorithm is given in a theorem in Section III. A byproduct of this algorithm is a somewhat remote, but unexpected, relation to physical optics. This is discussed in Section VI. View full abstract},

@article{Stevens:2009dr,
  abstract = {Studies dating back to 1834 have shown that the temperature of objects contacting the skin can substantially intensify their apparent pressure on the skin. Later research demonstrated qualitatively that object temperature can also sharpen the spatial acuity of the skin as revealed by gap perception (two-point and two-edge thresholds). Pressure intensification and sharpening probably relate intimately. The present experiments sought to provide several more accurate and parametric extensions of thermal sharpening: (1) sharpening can improve tactile spatial acuity by as much as 60\%, but the degree of sharpening is graded as a function of deviation of stimulator temperature from normal (neutral) skin temperature; (2) thermal sharpening seems to characterize the body surface since it takes place freely in forearm, forehead, and palm; local differences do, however, become apparent; (3) large thermal sharpening can even occur when one tip of the stimulator is warm, the other cold; and (4) thermal sharpening is e...},

In this paper, we present five cases in which we have developed installations that employ 3D projection on physical objects. The installations have been developed in collaboration with external partners and have been put into use in real-life settings such as museums, exhibitions and interaction design laboratories. On the basis of these cases, we present and discuss three central design insights concerning new potentials for well-known 3D effects, dynamics between digital world and physical world, and relations between object, content and context.},

We measured time- to-target and error rates, but also measured the time spent by participants to look at the screen. We found a 28\% decrease of reliance on vision when tactile feedback was enabled.},

The Gesture Watch utilizes an array of infrared proximity sensors to sense hand gestures made over the device and interprets the gestures using hidden Markov models. The Gesture Watch maps intuitive gross hand gestures to control signals such as the play and pause commands commonly found on mobile media players. We present our evaluation of the Gesture Watch designed to de- termine its the accuracy and usability. In our study, 10 par- ticipants used the Gesture Watch in both mobile and station- ary conditions as well as indoors and outdoors. Overall, we attained a recognition accuracy of 95.5\% and found that the Gesture Watch worked well in both indoor and outdoor en- vironments and while mobile.},

The conference took place in an avatar-based 3D virtual world with spatialized audio, and had keynote, poster and social sessions. We studied it by drawing on logs, a survey and interviews with 30 participants. We develop a model \textendash{} Coalescence, Focused Interaction, Remixing (CoFIRe) \textendash{} of large synchronous interactions, and use it to discuss how the technology supported, or failed to support, the interactions that are the raison detre of conferences. We conclude by discussing the prospects for such large virtual gatherings.},

@article{Margolis:1999gn,
  abstract = {For nearly four years (1995-9), we have interviewed female and male computer science students about their experiences studying computer science at Carnegie Mellon University, in one of the top computer science departments in the country (USA). We heard differences in orientations to computing in men's and women's interviews when they arrive at the university. We have traced the effects of these differences on women's sense of belonging and comfort in the program, and on their decisions to stay or leave. While most of the male students describe an early and persistent magnetic attraction between themselves and computers, women much more frequently link their computer science interest to a larger societal framework. Nearly half of the women we interviewed attached their interest in computer science to other arenas, such as medicine, education, space exploration, and the arts. For many of these women, while interest in computing is strong, they are concerned that their study of computer science not require a myopic focus on the machine, or detach them from people and other concerns. We discuss how computer science curriculum and culture frequently mirror and bestow prestige on an orientation toward computing commonly identified with men, while devaluing and pushing to the margins the orientations associated with women. The identification of computing as a male domain is so pervasive that men suffer far less from a mismatch with the dominant culture than do women. In this context, we discuss the importance of {{\&}}ldquo;revisioning{{\&}}rdquo; computer science, so that the answer to the question: {{\&}}ldquo;what is computer science?{{\&}}rdquo; incorporates and values women's perspectives as well as men's},

Location is the most common form of context used by these agents to determine the user's task. However, another potential use of location context is the creation of a predictive model of the user's future movements. We present a system that automatically clusters GPS data taken over an extended period of time into meaningful locations at multiple scales. These locations are then incorporated into a Markov model that can be consulted for use with a variety of applications in both single-user and collaborative scenarios. View full abstract},

@article{Saxena:2006ks,
  abstract = {Recently several researchers and practitioners have begun to address the problem of how to set up secure communication between two devices without the assistance of a trusted third party. McCune et al., (2005) proposed that one device displays the hash of its public key in the form of a barcode, and the other device reads it using a camera. Mutual authentication requires switching the roles of the devices and repeating the above process in the reverse direction. In this paper, we show how strong mutual authentication can be achieved even with a unidirectional visual channel, without having to switch device roles. By adopting recently proposed improved pairing protocols, we propose how visual channel authentication can be used even on devices that have very limited displaying capabilities View full abstract},

  abstract = {A global approach to hand gesture vocabulary design is proposed which includes human as well as technical design factors. The method of selecting gestures for preconceived command vocabularies has not been addressed in a systematic manner. Present methods are ad hoc. In an analytical approach technological factors of gesture recognition accuracy are easily obtained and well studied. Conversely, it is difficult to obtain measures of human centered desires (intuitiveness, comfort). These factors, being subjective, are costly and time consuming to obtain, and hence we have developed automated methods for acquisition of these data through specially designed applications. Results of the intuitiveness experiments showed when commands are presented as stimuli the gestural responses vary widely over a population of subjects. This result refutes the hypothesis that there exist universal common gestures to express user intentions or commands.},

  abstract = {Time series motifs are pairs of individual time series, or subsequences of a longer time series, which are very similar to each other. As with their discrete analogues in computational biology, this similarity hints at structure which has been conserved for some reason and may therefore be of interest. Since the formalism of time series motifs in 2002, dozens of researchers have used them for diverse applications in many different domains. Because the obvious algorithm for computing motifs is quadratic in the number of items, more than a dozen approximate algorithms to discover motifs have been proposed in the literature. In this work, for the first time, we show a tractable exact algorithm to find time series motifs. As we shall show through extensive experiments, our algorithm is up to three orders of magnitude faster than brute-force search in large datasets. We further show that our algorithm is fast enough to be used as a subroutine in higher level data mining algorithms for anytime classification, near-duplicate detection and summarization, and we consider detailed case studies in domains as diverse as electroencephalograph interpretation and entomological telemetry data mining.},

  abstract = {While very large collaborative surfaces are already being widely employed to facilitate concurrent interactions with multiple users, they involve no personalization in the touch interactions. Augmenting them to identify the touch interactions with multiple smart-phones can enable interesting co-located communal applications with context-based personalized interactions and information exchange amongst users' portable devices and the shared wall display. This paper proposes a novel matching technique, called tilt correlation, which employs the built-in tilt sensor to identify smart-phones that make concurrent two-point contacts on a common multi-touch wall display. Experimental investigations suggest that the resultant error rate is relatively low; in addition, we also propose a quantitative measure, called the Bourne Identity Index to allow application designers to determine the reliability of each device identification.},

The reference model explicitly captures concepts subject to distribution at different levels of abstraction (tasks, concepts, abstract UI, concrete UI, and deployed UI) so as to provide designers with a specification mechanism that enables them to express distribution. Some representative types of distributed UI are expressed according to the reference model to exemplify its usage.},

  abstract = {The evolution of human-to-computer input devices lags far behind the evolution of processing power. In this paper, we present work on merging MEMS force sensors and existing wireless technologies to develop a novel multifunctional interface input system, the Micro Input Devices System (MIDS), which could potentially replace the mouse, the pen, and the keyboard as input devices to the computer. Moreover, initial experimental results indicate that further exploration of this technology could eventually produce a new control-input device for grasping robotic manipulators. We have thus far developed a prototype MIDS that consists of two MIDS rings, each packaged with commercial MEMS acceleration sensors to sense multi-axes motion, and a MIDS wrist watch that communicates with the rings and transmits data wirelessly to interface with a CPU. The system has been demonstrated to perform click and drawing motions successfully. A self-calibration method was also developed to resolve ambiguities in sensed motion for the MEMS sensors.},

Our method is based on a natural partitioning of continuous sensor signals and uses a two-stage approach for the spotting task. In a first stage, signal sections likely to contain specific motion events are preselected using a simple similarity search. Those preselected sections are then further classified in a second stage, exploiting the recognition capabilities of hidden Markov models. Based on two case studies, we discuss implementation details of our approach and show that it is a feasible strategy for the spotting of various types of motion events.},

  abstract = {In a wireless world, users can establish connections between devices spontaneously, and unhampered by cables. However, in the absence of cables, what is the natural interaction to connect one device with another? A wide range of device association techniques have been demonstrated, but it has remained an open question what actions users would spontaneously choose for device association. We contribute a study eliciting device association actions from non-technical users without premeditation. Over 700 user-defined actions were collected for 37 different device combinations. We present a classification of user-defined actions, and observations of the users' rationale. Our findings indicate that there is no single most spontaneous action; instead five prominent categories of user-defined actions were found.},

@article{Fujii:2007p7399,
  abstract = {Recently, wearable devices which use the human body as a transmission channel have been developed. However, there has been a lack of information related to the transmission mechanism of such devices in the physical layer. Electromagnetic communication trials using the human body as a transmission medium have more than a decade's history. However, most of the researches have been conducted by researchers who just want to utilize the fact and practically no physical mechanisms have been researched until recently. Hence, in this paper, the authors propose some calculation models of the human body equipped with the wearable devices by using the finite difference time domain (FDTD) method. Moreover, a biological tissue-equivalent solid phantom is utilized to show the validity of the calculation. From these investigations, the authors determine the transmission mechanism of the wearable devices using the human body as a transmission channel.},

@techreport{Sturdee:2015ur,
  abstract = {The development of dynamic, shape-changing interfaces as a method of human-computer interaction is receiving increasing attention in both research and manufacturing. The present focus is mainly on hardware development, rather than potential applications. To advance this area, considering temporality in shape-changing displays and interfaces is vital in understanding how to design applications for (and with) such devices. Prototypes within the field range from those which actuate changes at high speed, to the deliberately slow, with a complex range of temporal movement in between. Current research highlights the importance of temporal form in interaction design, and expressive movement, but this is yet to be applied in detail to shape-change. This paper examines the current state of play for temporality in shape-changing interfaces, examines the role of time and design in existing prototypes, and proposes an adaptive methodology for design utilising time, space and shape based on previous research.},

These decisions are based on the social and public settings where these devices are used on a daily basis. Our ideas about which gestures are socially acceptable or not are an important factor in whether or not these gestures will be adopted. The ways in which users evaluate social acceptability is not only highly variable, but with drastically different results amongst different users. These differences are not dependant on factors such as age, gender, occupation, geographic location, or previous technology usage. Future work into the social acceptability perceptions of users will focus on personality traits as a new way of understanding how social acceptability is determined.},

@article{Tanikella:2017km,
  abstract = {Recent advancements in open-source self-replicating rapid prototypers (RepRap) have radically reduced costs of 3-D printing. The cost of additive manufacturing enables distributed manufacturing of open source appropriate technologies (OSAT) to assist in sustainable development. In order to investigate the potential this study makes a careful investigation of the use of RepRap 3-D printers to fabricate widely used Black Mamba bicycle components in the developing world. Specifically, this study tests pedals. A CAD model of the pedal was created using parametric open source software (FreeCAD) to enable future customization. Then poly-lactic acid, a biodegradable and recyclable bioplastic was selected among the various commercial 3-D printable materials based on strength and cost. The pedal was 3-D printed on a commercial RepRap and tested following the CEN (European Committee for Standardization) standards for racing bicycles for 1) static strength, 2) impact, and 3) dynamic durability. The results show the pedals meet the CEN standards and can be used on bicycles. The 3-D printed pedals are significantly lighter than the stock pedals used on the Black Mamba, which provides a performance enhancement while reducing the cost if raw PLA or recycled materials are used, which assists in reducing bicycle costs even for those living in extreme poverty. Other bicycle parts could also be manufactured using 3-D printers for a return on investment on the 3-D printer indicating that this model of distributed manufacturing of OSAT may be technically and economically appropriate through much of the Global South.},

Six children without disabilities were provided with drawing and craft materials and were asked to develop low-tech prototypes of inventions to support the communication of a young child who had significant speech and motor impairments. The design process and the inventions were analyzed using qualitative methods. Results showed that the children's inventions differed significantly from the designs of current AAC technologies. Their inventions were not simply speech prostheses; rather, they integrated multiple functions (e.g., communication, social interaction, companionship, play, artistic expression, telecommunications) and provided dynamic contexts to support social interactions with others, especially peers. The children characterized the systems as companions and utilized innovative names, bright colors, lights, transformable shapes...},

  abstract = {Structured-light systems are simple and effective tools to acquire 3D models. Built with off-the-shelf components, a data projector and a camera, they are easy to deploy and compare in precision with expensive laser scanners. But such a high precision is only possible if camera and projector are both accurately calibrated. Robust calibration methods are well established for cameras but, while cameras and projectors can both be described with the same mathematical model, it is not clear how to adapt these methods to projectors. In consequence, many of the proposed projector calibration techniques make use of a simplified model, neglecting lens distortion, resulting in loss of precision. In this paper, we present a novel method to estimate the image coordinates of 3D points in the projector image plane. The method relies on an uncalibrated camera and makes use of local homographies to reach sub-pixel precision. As a result, any camera model can be used to describe the projector, including the extended pinhole model with radial and tangential distortion coefficients, or even those with more complex lens distortion models.

  abstract = {Gesture recognition is emerging as an engaging interaction technique in mobile scenarios, and high recognition rates promote user acceptance. Several factors influence recognition rates including the nature of the gesture set and the suitability of the gesture recognition algorithm. This work explores how seamfulness in gesture stroke visualization affects recognition rates. We present the results of a user evaluation of a gesture recognition system that shows that raw (seamful) visualization of lowfidelity gesture stroke data has recognition rates comparable to no feedback. Providing filtered (seamless) stroke visualization to the user, while retaining the unfiltered input data for recognition, resulted in a 34.9\% improvement in gesture recognition rate over raw stroke data. The results provide insights into the broader design space of seamful design, and identifies areas where seamlessness is advantageous.},

Consumers can better understand how to save electricity by gaining awareness of their consumption beyond the typical monthly bill. We conducted a study to understand consumers awareness of energy consumption in the home and to determine their requirements for an interactive, always-on interface for exploring data to gain awareness of home energy consumption. In this paper, we describe a three-stage approach to supporting electricity conservation routines: raise awareness, inform complex changes, and maintain sustainable routines. We then present the findings from our study to support design implications for energy consumption feedback interfaces.},

@article{Kang:2004p3310,
  abstract = {In vision-based interfaces for video games, gestures are used as commands for the games instead of pressing buttons on a keyboard or moving a mouse. In these interfaces, unintentional movements and continuous gestures must be supported to provide the user with a more natural interface. This paper proposes a novel gesture spotting method that combines gesture spotting with gesture recognition. It recognizes the meaningful movements while concurrently separating unintentional movements from a given image sequence. We applied our method to the recognition of upper-body gestures as the interface between a video game (Quake II) and its user. Experimental results show that the proposed method is, on average, 93.36\% reliable in spotting gestures from continuous gestures, confirming its potential for a gesture-based interface for computer games.},

@article{Zeng:2007p2993,
  abstract = {Automated analysis of human affective behavior has attracted increasing attention from researchers in psychology, computer science, linguistics, neuroscience, and related disciplines. Promising approaches have been reported, including automatic methods for facial and vocal affect recognition. However, the existing methods typically handle only deliberately displayed and exaggerated expressions of prototypical emotions-despite the fact that deliberate behavior differs in visual and audio expressions from spontaneously occurring behavior. Recently efforts to develop algorithms that can process naturally occurring human affective behavior have emerged. This paper surveys these efforts. We first discuss human emotion perception from a psychological perspective. Next, we examine the available approaches to solving the problem of machine understanding of human affective behavior occurring in real-world settings. We finally outline some scientific and engineering challenges for advancing human affect sensing technology.},

While the contents of these bills are freely available for download, understanding them is a significant challenge to experts and average citizens alike due to their length, complex language, and obscure topics. To make these important documents more accessible to the general public, we present Many Bills (http://manybills.us): a web-based set of visualization tools that reveals the underlying semantics of a bill. Using machine learning techniques, we classify each bills sections based on existing document-level categories. We then visualize the resulting topic substructure of these bills. These visualizations provide an overview-and-detail view of bills, enabling users to read individual sections of a bill and compare topic patterns across multiple bills. Through an overview of the sites user activity and interviews with active users, this paper highlights how Many Bills makes the tasks of reading bills, identifying outlier sections in bills, and understanding congresspersons legislative activity more manageable.},

As a candidate for a novel musical instrument, we propose a networked wearable musical instrument. This paper describes the design of the networked musical instrument as well as a prototype system. Furthermore, we demonstrate several possible novel applications of the networked wearable musical instrument. We think that this networked wearable musical instrument will bring us a novel type of musical entertainment and a novel musical culture},

As computational ability continues to be implemented in more and more objects and devices, new interaction methods need to be developed. The Graspables System is embodied by a physical set of sensors combined with pattern recognition software that can determine how users hold a device. The Graspables System has been implemented in two prototypes, the Bar of Soap and the Ball of Soap. Applications developed for these prototypes demonstrate the effectiveness of grasp-recognition as an interface in multiple scenarios.},

  abstract = {Despite the prominence of multi-touch technologies, there has been little work investigating its integration into the desktop environment. Bringing multi-touch into desktop computing would give users an additional input channel to leverage, enriching the current interaction paradigm dominated by a mouse and keyboard. We provide two main contributions in this domain. First, we describe the results from a study we performed, which systematically evaluates the various potential regions within the traditional desktop configuration that could become multi-touch enabled. The study sheds light on good or bad regions for multi-touch, and also the type of input most appropriate for each of these regions. Second, guided by the results from our study, we explore the design space of multi-touch-integrated desktop experiences. A set of new interaction techniques are coherently integrated into a desktop prototype, called Magic Desk, demonstrating potential uses for multi-touch enabled desktop configurations.},

However, these seemingly innocuous measurements can be used to infer potentially private behaviors such as stress, conversation, smoking, drinking, illicit drug usage, and others. We conducted a study to assess how concerned people are about disclosure of a variety of behaviors and contexts that are embedded in wearable sensor data. Our results show participants are most concerned about disclosures of conversation episodes and stress \textendash{} inferences that are not yet widely publicized. These concerns are mediated by temporal and physical context associated with the data and the participant's personal stake in the data. Our results provide key guidance on the extent to which people understand the potential for harm and data characteristics researchers should focus on to reduce the perceived harm from such datasets.},

Gestures here are hand movements which are recorded by a 3D accelerometer embedded in a handheld device. In addition to standard hidden Markov model classifier, the recognition system has a preprocessing step which removes the effect of device orientation from the data. The performance of the recognizer is evaluated in both user dependent and user independent cases. The effects of sample resolution and sampling rate are studied in the user dependent case.},

  abstract = {Augmented haptics lets users touch surface information of any modality. SmartTouch uses optical sensors to gather information and electrical stimulation to translate it into tactile display. Augmented reality is an engineer's approach to this dream. In AR, sensors capture artificial information from the world, and existing sensing channels display it. Hence, we virtually acquire the sensor's physical ability as our own. Augmented haptics, the result of applying AR to haptics, would allow a person to touch the untouchable. Our system, SmartTouch, uses a tactile display and a sensor. When the sensor contacts an object, an electrical stimulation translates the acquired information into a tactile sensation, such as a vibration or pressure, through the tactile display. Thus, an individual not only makes physical contact with an object, but also touches the surface information of any modality, even those that are typically untouchable. View full abstract},

In this paper, we present a survey of the previous definitions, metrics, and evaluation methodologies which have been used for software learnability. Our survey of evaluation methodologies leads us to a new question-suggestion protocol, which, in a user study, was shown to expose a significantly higher number of learnability issues in comparison to a more traditional think-aloud protocol. Based on the issues identified in our study, we present a classification system of learnability issues, and demonstrate how these categories can lead to guidelines for addressing the associated challenges.},

  abstract = {To make motion gestures more widely adopted on mobile devices it is important that devices be able to distinguish between motion intended for mobile interaction and every-day motion. In this paper, we present DoubleFlip, a unique motion gesture designed as an input delimiter for mobile motion-based interaction. The DoubleFlip gesture is distinct from regular motion of a mobile device. Based on a collec-tion of 2,100 hours of motion data captured from 99 users, we found that our DoubleFlip recognizer is extremely resis-tant to false positive conditions, while still achieving a high recognition rate. Since DoubleFlip is easy to perform and unlikely to be accidentally invoked, it provides an always-active input event for mobile interaction.},

@article{Baudisch:2011ks,
  abstract = {Advances in sensing technology are currently bringing touch input to non-planar surfaces, ranging from spherical touch screens to prototypes the size and shape of a ping-pong ball. To help interface designers create usable interfaces on such devices, we determine how touch surface curvature affects targeting. We present a user study in which participants acquired targets on surfaces of different curvature and at locations of different slope. We find that surface convexity increases pointing accuracy, and in particular reduces the offset between the input point perceived by users and the input point sensed by the device. Concave surfaces, in contrast, are subject to larger error offsets. This is likely caused by how concave surfaces hug the users finger, thus resulting in a larger contact area. The effect of slope on targeting, in contrast, is unexpected at first sight. Some targets located downhill from the users perspective are subject to error offsets in the opposite direction from all others. This appears to be caused by participants acquiring these targets using a different finger posture that lets them monitor the position of their fingers more effectively.},

  abstract = {Mobile input technologies can be bulky, obtrusive, or difficult to use while performing other tasks. In this paper, we present Hambone, a lightweight, unobtrusive system that affords quick access, subtlety, and multitasking capabilities for gesture-based mobile device interaction. Hambone uses two small piezoelectric sensors placed on either the wrist or ankle. When a user moves his hands or feet, the sounds generated by the movement travel to Hambone via bone conduction. Hambone then transmits the signals digitally to a mobile device or computer. The signals are recognized using hidden Markov models (HMMs) and are mapped to a set of commands controlling an application. In this paper, we present the hardware and software implementation of Hambone, a preliminary evaluation, and a discussion of future opportunities in bio-acoustic gesture-based interfaces},

  abstract = {A complete microcomputer system is described, GesRec3D, which facilitates the data acquisition, segmentation, learning, and recognition of 3-Dimensional arm gestures, with application as a Augmentative and Alternative Communication (AAC) aid for people with motor and speech disability. The gesture data is acquired from a Polhemus electro-magnetic tracker system, with sensors attached to the finger, wrist and elbow of one arm. Coded gestures are linked to user-defined text, to be spoken by a text-to-speech engine that is integrated into the system. A segmentation method and an algorithm for classification are presented that includes acceptance/rejection thresholds based on intra-class and inter-class dissimilarity measures. Results of recognition hits, confusion misses and rejection misses are given for two experiments, involving predefined and arbitrary 3D gestures.},

@inproceedings{Yagi:2012ve,
  abstract = {For healthy chewing, well equilibrated occlusion is necessary to minimize unexpected overloading of the tooth. However, the current occlusal examination depends on techniques, skills and sense of doctors. In this research, we are focusing on that occlusal condition is related to sound from teeth, and have developed a novel occlusal checking system detecting the sound. The system is configured with multiple sound detecting devices. Each device consists of a soft suction cup and a miniature microphone. The suction cup can be adhered on a tooth by applying negative pressure through a tube, and the microphone is inserted into the tube. Therefore when a patient bites, generated sound from the target tooth can be detected by the microphone. First, we have found out the relationship between adhesion force and applied negative pressure to the suction cup, and decided optimum value of negative pressure. Then, by using two devices, we have conducted experiments of detecting occlusal sound using a jaw model for confirming the potential of this system. Furthermore, we carried out the experiments in the oral cavity, and we succeeded in detecting sounds from tooth by using fabricated devices},

The final operating version was rested in Shannon's basement home lab in June of 1961. The cigarette pack sized analog device yielded an expected gain of +44\% when betting on the most favored "octant". The Shannons and Thorps tested the computer in Las Vegas in the summer of 1961. The predictions there were consistent with the laboratory expected gain of 44\% but a minor hardware problem deferred sustained serious betting. We kept the method and the existence of the computer secret until 1966. View full abstract},

  abstract = {Observational research on the social impact of cell phone usage in public places suggests that the mere presence of cell phones in public conflicts the private and public spheres and inhibits social interaction with proximate others (strangers or known persons). The purpose of this paper is to develop a theoretical model for which social effects of cell phone usage in public places documented in observational studies can be empirically tested. In this paper, we discuss various variables to consider in the study of cell phone usage (CPU) and social interaction with proximate others (SIPO). We offer a modest experiment of CPU in the context of social participation, a form of social interaction. Focusing on helping behavior in particular, results indicate that while on the cell phone, users are less likely to offer help. Findings imply that CPU in public places can distract users from social responsibilities, as they neglect the environment surrounding them.},

Our approach is to use non-speech sounds and haptics to allow a richer and more flexible form of access to graphs and tables. Method : Two experiments are reported that test out designs for both sound and haptic graph solutions. In the audio case a standard speech interface is compared to one with non-speech sounds added. The haptic experiment compares two different graph designs to see which was the most effective. Results : Our results for the sound graphs showed a significant decrease in subjective workload, reduced time taken to complete tasks and reduced errors as compared to a standard speech interface. For the haptic graphs reductions in workload and some of the problems that can occur when using such graphs are shown. Conclusions : Using non-speech sound and haptics can significantly improve interaction with visuali...},

  abstract = {StoryVisit allows children and long-distance adults to experience a sense of togetherness by reading childrens story books together over a distance. StoryVisit combines video conferencing and connected books: remote grown-up and child readers can see and hear each other, and can also see and control the same e-book. We report on research with 61 families \textendash{} over 200 users including parents, children and long-distance readers \textendash{} who used StoryVisit in their homes with a long-distance reader for at least one reading session. In addition, we report qualitative findings regarding nineteen of the families who participated in telephone interviews and four families who were monitored and interviewed by researchers at home. Results show that connected e-book video chat sessions last about five times as long as the typical video chats reported in previous research on families with young children. Moreover, the addition of an animated character increased session lengths by another 50\%. StoryVisit usage peaked for families with three year olds, showing that sustained distance interactions with very young children are possible if communication technologies incorporate joint activities that engage children and adults.},

  abstract = {Energy problems arise with the proliferation of mobile electronic devices, which range from entertainment tools to life saving medical instruments. The large amount of energy consumption and increasing mobility of electronic devices make it urgent that new power sources should be developed. It has been gradually recognized that the human body is highly flexible in generating applicable power from sources of heat dissipation, joint rotation, enforcement of body weight, vertical displacement of mass centers, and even elastic deformation of tissues and other attachments. These basic combinations of daily activities or metabolic phenomena open up possibilities for harvesting energy which is strong enough to power mobile or even implantable medical devices which could be used for a long time or be recharged permanently. A comprehensive review is presented in this paper on the latest developed or incubating electricity generation methods based on human power which would serve as promising candidates for future mobile power.},

  abstract = {We present TUIC, a technology that enables tangible interaction on capacitive multi-touch devices, such as iPad, iPhone, and 3Ms multi-touch displays, without requiring any hardware modifications. TUIC simulates finger touches on capacitive displays using passive materials and active modulation circuits embedded inside tangible objects, and can be used with multi-touch gestures simultaneously. TUIC consists of three approaches to sense and track objects: spatial, frequency, and hybrid (spatial plus frequency). The spatial approach, also known as 2D markers, uses geometric, multi-point touch patterns to encode object IDs. Spatial tags are straightforward to construct and are easily tracked when moved, but require sufficient spacing between the multiple touch points. The frequency approach uses modulation circuits to generate high-frequency touches to encode object IDs in the time domain. It requires fewer touch points and allows smaller tags to be built. The hybrid approach combines both spatial and frequency tags to construct small tags that can be reliably tracked when moved and rotated. We show three applications demonstrating the above approaches on iPads and 3Ms multi-touch displays.},

We interviewed 14 pairs of parents and children (ages 7 \textendash{} 13) from work-separated families to understand their experiences and the strategies that they use to keep their family together. Parents focus on combining scheduled synchronous and spontaneous asynchronous communication to maintain a constant presence in the life of the child. Children, on the other hand, focus on other sources of support, on other activities, and on the eventual reunion. Both the remote parent and the child rely heavily on a collocated adult to maintain awareness and contact. We compare work-separated families with other types of separation and highlight opportunities for new designs.},

In addition to improving the robustness of Fitts law models, these recommendations (if widely employed) will improve the comparability and consistency of forthcoming publications. Arguments to support these recommendations are presented, as are concise reviews of 24 published Fitts law models of the mouse, and 9 studies that used the new ISO standard.},

The system employs an intraoral electrode array, and an embedded controller that provides communication with the target computer. The position and the movement of the tongue are detected by measuring the contact impedance between the tip of the tongue and the electrode array. The system is implemented such that it can easily be expanded to support the translation of tongue gestures into mouse cursor movements, and clicks, for the purpose of controlling a computer, in a similar fashion to a laptop touchpad},

  abstract = {\textexclamdown{}p\textquestiondown{}In most macroscale robotic systems, propulsion and controls are enabled through a physical tether or complex onboard electronics and batteries. A tether simplifies the design process but limits the range of motion of the robot, while onboard controls and power supplies are heavy and complicate the design process. Here, we present a simple design principle for an untethered, soft swimming robot with preprogrammed, directional propulsion without a battery or onboard electronics. Locomotion is achieved by using actuators that harness the large displacements of bistable elements triggered by surrounding temperature changes. Powered by shape memory polymer (SMP) muscles, the bistable elements in turn actuate the robots fins. Our robots are fabricated using a commercially available 3D printer in a single print. As a proof of concept, we show the ability to program a vessel, which can autonomously deliver a cargo and navigate back to the deployment point.\textexclamdown/p\textquestiondown{}},

  abstract = {Enabling efficient exploration of large-scale virtual environments such as those simulating astrophysical environments is highly challenging. Astrophysical virtual worlds span exceptionally large spatial scales occupied mostly by empty space, and this makes it difficult for the user to comprehend the spatial context during exploratory navigation. Public exhibits, where novice users have little experience using complicated virtual navigation interfaces, pose additional challenges.To address these issues, we propose multi-touch techniques to deliver an effective interface to navigate the unique features of large-scale 3D environments such as astrophysical simulations. In this work, we carefully study conventional multi-touch methods and adapt them to the practical requirements of this application. A novel technique called the powersof-ten ladder is introduced to support efficient movement across huge spatial scales using multi-touch interactions. We also investigate user experiences with various multi-touch finger gestures on our prototype digital planetarium.},

While these avenues of research have been fruitful their accomplishments do not match up to anything like Weisers world. This paper discusses why this is so and argues that is time for a change of direction in the field. An alternative agenda is outlined that focuses on engaging rather than calming people. Humans are very resourceful at exploiting their environments and extending their capabilities using existing strategies and tools.

  abstract = {This article discusses how digital fabrication affects the production of electronic devices, drawing on the author's experience making radios, speakers, mice, and cellphones. Several case studies demonstrate the differences between digital fabrication and traditional mass-production or do-it-yourself (DIY) practices. The author analyzes how the digital nature of design files and the flexibility of fabricating them into physical objects transform the design and production of enclosures and circuit boards, but has less effect on component sourcing, circuit assembly, and programming. The author also explores how different people can get involved in the process of fabricating devices, the skills required, and relevant motivations. This article is part of a special issue on printing and fabrication. View full abstract},

However, current tools are ill-suited for these users. They have steep learning curves and don't take into account that the end goal is a physical object, not a digital model. A new class of "maker"-level design tools is needed to accompany this new commodity hardware. However, recent examples of such tools achieve accessibility primarily by constraining functionality. In contrast, the meshmixer project is building tools that provide accessibility and expressive power by leveraging recent computer graphics research in geometry processing. The project members have had positive experiences with several 3D-design-to-print workshops and are exploring several design-to-fabricate problems. This article is part of a special issue on 3D printing. View full abstract},

@article{Vlachos:2006p3293,
  abstract = {Abstract While most time series data mining research has concentrated on providing solutions for a single distance function, in this work we motivate the need for an index structure that can support multiple distance measures. Our specific area of interest is the efficient retrieval and analysis of similar trajectories. Trajectory datasets are very common in environmental applications, mobility experiments, and video surveillance and are especially important for the discovery of certain biological patterns. Our primary similarity measure is based on the longest common subsequence (LCSS) model that offers enhanced robustness, particularly for noisy data, which are encountered very often in real-world applications. However, our index is able to accommodate other distance measures as well, including the ubiquitous Euclidean distance and the increasingly popular dynamic time warping (DTW). While other researchers have advocated one or other of these similarity measures, a major contribution of our work is the ability to support all these measures without the need to restructure the index. Our framework guarantees no false dismissals and can also be tailored to provide much faster response time at the expense of slightly reduced precision/recall. The experimental results demonstrate that our index can help speed up the computation of expensive similarity measures such as the LCSS and the DTW.},

  abstract = {Many disciplines of multimedia and communication go towards ubiquitous computing and hand-free- and no-touch interaction with computers. Application domains in this direction involve virtual reality, augmented reality, wearable computing, and smart spaces, where gesturing is a possible method of interaction. This paper presents some important issues in choosing the set of gestures for the interface from a user-centred view such as the learning rate, ergonomics, and intuition. A procedure is proposed which includes those issues in the selection of gestures, and to test the resulting set of gestures. The procedure is tested and demonstrated on an example application with a small test group. The procedure is concluded to be useful for finding a basis for the choice of gestures. The importance of tailoring the gesture vocabulary for the user group was also shown.},

@article{Chien:2009p7685,
  abstract = {Previous studies have shown that dynamic displays during rapid serial visual presentation (RSVP) privilege temporal rather that spatial information in overcoming the limits of small screens. Such studies have been conducted under stationary or idealized conditions using conventional desktop-paradigm evaluation strategies, resulting in deficient understandings of how changes in motion affect users ability to perform effectively. This study examined the impact of two important dynamic display factors on the reading comprehension achieved by participants while walking on a predefined path and standing: word-by-word and one-line presentation formats and presentation rates of 182, 232, 282, and 332 characters per minute (cpm). The results of this study showed that an RSVP display can represent an alternative for reading textual information when a word-by-word format is presented with a 332-cpm presentation rate. When the one-line presentation format is used, however, a lower presentation rate of 282 cpm should be chosen. Future research should attempt to simulate real life more closely and explore the effects of the multiple functions performed by various RSVP displays on reading comfort and comprehension.},

  abstract = {The last few years have seen an increasing understanding that Dynamic Time Warping (DTW), a technique that allows local flexibility in aligning time series, is superior to the ubiquitous Euclidean Distance for time series classification, clustering, and indexing. More recently, it has been shown that for some problems, Uniform Scaling (US), a technique that allows global scaling of time series, may just be as important for some problems. In this work, we note that for many real world problems, it is necessary to combine both DTW and US to achieve meaningful results. This is particularly true in domains where we must account for the natural variability of human action, including biometrics, query by humming, motion-capture/animation, and handwriting recognition. We introduce the first technique which can handle both DTW and US simultaneously, and demonstrate its utility and effectiveness on a wide range of problems in industry, medicine, and entertainment.},

  abstract = {In this paper we describe a technique for choosing multiple colours for use during data visualization. Our goal is a systematic method for maximizing the total number of colours available for use, while still allowing an observer to rapidly and accurately search a display for any one of the given colours. Previous research suggests that we need to consider three separate effects during colour selection: colour distance, linear separation, and colour category. We describe a simple method for measuring and controlling all of these effects. Our method was tested by performing a set of target identification studies; we analysed the ability of thirty-eight observers to find a colour target in displays that contained differently coloured background elements. Results showed that our method can be used to select a group of colours that will provide good differentiation between data elements during visualization.},

@article{Fu:2008p3308,
  abstract = {The last few years have seen an increasing understanding that dynamic time warping (DTW), a technique that allows local flexibility in aligning time series, is superior to the ubiquitous Euclidean distance for time series classification, clustering, and indexing. More recently, it has been shown that for some problems, uniform scaling (US), a technique that allows global scaling of time series, may just be as important for some problems. In this work, we note that for many real world problems, it is necessary to combine both DTW and US to achieve meaningful results. This is particularly true in domains where we must account for the natural variability of human actions, including biometrics, query by humming, motion-capture/animation, and handwriting recognition. We introduce the first technique which can handle both DTW and US simultaneously, our techniques involve search pruning by means of a lower bounding technique and multi-dimensional indexing to speed up the search. We demonstrate the utility and effectiveness of our method on a wide range of problems in industry, medicine, and entertainment.},

Such an interface may provide a solution to the problem of limited screen space in handheld devices and lead to an effective interface for mobile/eyes-free computing. To better understand how we might design such an interface, our study compared three potential interaction techniques: head nodding, pointing with a finger and pointing on a touch tablet to select an item in exocentric 3D audio space. The effects of sound direction and interaction technique on the browsing and selection process were analyzed. An estimate of the size of the minimum selection area that would allow efficient 3D sound selection is provided for each interaction technique. Browsing using the touch screen was found to be more accurate than the other two techniques, but participants found it significantly harder to use.},

  abstract = {Detection thresholds and intensity-difference thresholds were measured on four subjects ranging in age from 19 to 22 years. The stimuli were 250-Hz bursts of vibration applied through a 3.0 cm2 contactor to the thenar eminence of the right hand. Detection thresholds were substantially higher at 20 Cthan at 30 or 40 C and were only slightly higher at 40 C than 30 C.When the intensity-difference threshold was expressed in relative terms, as the proportion by which two stimuli must differ in amplitude to be discriminated (Deltaphi/phi), discrimination capacities were unaffected by surface-skin temperature. The results are consistent with the hypothesis that surface-skin temperature alters the sensitivity of tactile receptors, and that, because of the 'near miss' to Weber's law, the relative difference threshold is unaffected substantially by skin temperature. It was concluded that, at least a partial explanation of the 'near miss' lies in the fact that, at low to moderate sensation levels, the P channel is e...},

  abstract = {This paper takes up the problem of understanding why we preserve some things passionately and discard others without thought. We briefly report on the theoretical literature relating to this question, both in terms of existing literature in HCI, as well as in terms of related literatures that can advance the understanding for the HCI community. We use this reading to refine our frameworks for understanding durability in digital artifice as an issue of sustainable interaction design in HCI. Next, we report in detail on our ongoing work in collecting personal inventories of digital artifice in the home context. We relate our prior and most current personal inventories collections to the framework that owes to our reading of the theoretical literature. Finally, we summarize the theoretical implications and findings of our personal inventories work in terms of implications for the design of digital artifice in a manner that is more durable.},

  abstract = {Precise alignment of graphical objects and the creation of accurate layouts are crucial activities in many applications, such as graphics design tools, presentation software or graph editors. Surface computing is very promising for these application domains but not fully explored yet. In this paper we contribute two tools which support layout tasks on interactive displays: interactive grids and multi-touch alignment guides. Both tools allow the precise positioning of graphical objects in a flexible and fluent way by multi-touch input. Direct bimanual interaction and physical metaphors are applied to arrange objects along straight lines and curves. A formative user evaluation showed promising results with regard to a productive and easy use of the tools.},

  abstract = {Reading is increasingly being performed interactively on-screen; for instance, new novels are now routinely released in electronic format for viewing on PCs and mobile devices. Unfortunately, on-screen reading loses many of the natural features of conventional physical media, such as the ability to annotate, slip in bookmarks, turn page corners, and so on. How best should these features be represented electronically? Can computerized representations give benefits that excel the conventional benefits of paper? We describe the design and implementation of a novel reading system that mimics key properties of paper and surpasses them by incorporating digital techniques. A comparative user study evaluating the system confirmed the effectiveness of the features and the value of the system as a whole.},

The most common scheduling systems, in order of popularity, were paper-based day planners, memory, scrap paper, and PDAs. However, 43\% of the claimed PDA users and 68\% of day planner users switched to another, more readily accessible method when scheduling an appointment. Interviews revealed a practice of using memory or scrap paper to buffer appointments for later entry into the PDA or planner.},

The reliability of the questionnaire was high, Cronbach's alpha=.94. The overall reaction ratings yielded significantly higher ratings for liked software and MDA over disliked software and a CLS, respectively. Frequent and sophisticated PC users rated MDA more satisfying, powerful and flexible than CLS. Future applications of the QUIS on computers are discussed.},

Framing design as a thinking-by-doing activity foregrounds iteration as a central concern. This paper presents d.tools, a toolkit that embodies an iterative-design-centered approach to prototyping information appliances. This work offers contributions in three areas. First, d.tools introduces a statechart-based visual design tool that provides a low threshold for early-stage prototyping, extensible through code for higher-fidelity prototypes. Second, our research introduces three important types of hardware extensibility \textemdash{} at the hardware-to-PC interface, the intra-hardware communication level, and the circuit level. Third, d.tools integrates design, test, and analysis of information appliances. We have evaluated d.tools through three studies: a laboratory study with thirteen participants; rebuilding prototypes of existing and emerging devices; and by observing seven student teams who built prototypes with d.tools.},

  abstract = {We describe a virtual tether for mobile devices that allows groups to have quick, simple and privacy-preserving meetups. Our design provides cues which allow dynamic coordination of rendezvous without revealing users positions. Using accelerometers and magnetometers, combined with GPS positioning and non-visual feedback, users can probe and sense a dynamic virtual object representing the nearest meeting point. The Social Gravity system makes social bonds tangible in a virtual world which is geographically grounded, using haptic feedback to help users rendezvous. We show dynamic navigation using this physical model-based system to be efficient and robust in significant field trials, even in the presence of low-quality positioning. The use of simulators to build models of mobile geolocated systems for pre-validation purposes is discussed, and results compared with those from our trials. Our results show interesting behaviours in the social coordination task, which lead to guidelines for geosocial interaction design. The Social Gravity system proved to be very successful in allowing groups to rendezvous efficiently and simply and can be implemented using only commercially available hardware.},

Due to the mechanical conception of the probe, the sensor fits any finger topology and assures a constant force applied to the phalanx. Ambient light artifacts are rejected at the analog electronics level. Finally, an innovative distribution of light sources and detectors and a dedicated signal processing procedure resolve the anatomical heterogeneity of different phalanx topologies, compensate low perfusion indexes due to the phalanx anatomy and estimates equivalent pulse oximetry SpO2 indexes. First in-vivo validation results of the novel sensor are discussed at the end of the paper},

@article{Girouard:2011kl,
  abstract = {Flexible displays potentially allow for interaction styles that resemble those used in paper documents. Bending the display, e.g., to page forward, shows particular promise as an interaction technique. In this paper, we present an evaluation of the effectiveness of various bend gestures in executing a set of tasks with a flexible display. We discuss a study in which users designed bend gestures for common computing actions deployed on a smartphone-inspired flexible E Ink prototype called PaperPhone. We collected a total of 87 bend gesture pairs from ten participants and their appropriateness over twenty actions in five applications. We identi- fied six most frequently used bend gesture pairs out of 24 unique pairs. Results show users preferred bend gestures and bend gesture pairs that were conceptually simpler, e.g., along one axis, and less physically demanding. There was a strong agreement among participants to use the same three pairs in applications: (1) side of display, up/down (2) top corner, up/down (3) bottom corner, up/down. For actions with a strong directional cue, we found strong consensus on the polarity of the bend gestures (e.g., navigating left is performed with an upwards bend gesture, navigating right, downwards). This implies that bend gestures that take directional cues into account are likely more natural to users.},

In this paper we describe why this is a good model, why the interfaces need to be open, and why different parties in the value chain, such as wireless service providers and device manufacturers, may prefer such architecture. Our personal mobile hub supports multiple wireless protocols, some short range and some wide area so that the power of the Internet is available even to body worn sensors. We describe custom hardware that we built for this purpose and also the software necessary to make this concept work. We have tested out this architecture with an end-to-end application. The working system was demonstrated at the annual IBM Stockholders meeting in 2004 and is also available for customers to see at the IBM Industry Solutions Lab in Zurich.},

  abstract = {The procedure of manually generating a 3D model of an object is very time consuming for a human operator. Next best-view (NBV) planning is an important aspect for automation of this procedure in a robotic environment. We propose a surface-based NBV approach, which creates a triangle surface from a real-time data stream and determines viewpoints similar to human intuition. Thereby, the boundaries in the surface are detected and a quadratic patch for each boundary is estimated. Then several viewpoint candidates are calculated, which look perpendicular to the surface and overlap with previous sensor data. A NBV is selected with the goal to fill areas which are occluded. This approach focuses on the completion of a 3D model of an unknown object. Thereby, the search space for the viewpoints is not restricted to a cylinder or sphere. Our NBV determination proves to be very fast, and is evaluated in an experiment on test objects, applying an industrial robot and a laser range scanner. View full abstract},

  abstract = {We present an experimental comparison of multi-touch and tangible user interfaces for basic interface actions. Twelve participants completed manipulation and acquisition tasks on an interactive surface in each of three conditions: tangible user interface; multi-touch; and mouse and puck. We found that interface control objects in the tangible condition were easiest to acquire and, once acquired, were easier/more accurate to manipulate. Further qualitative analysis suggested that in the evaluated tasks tangibles offer greater adaptability of control and specifically highlighted a problem of exit error that can undermine fine-grained control in multi-touch interactions. We discuss the implications of these findings for interface design.},

@article{Ko:2008p6183,
  abstract = {Sensor fusion is concerned with gaining information from multiple sensors by fusing across raw data, features or decisions. Tradition- ally these fusion processes only concern fusion at specific points in time. However recently, there is a growing interest in inferring the behavioural aspects of environments or objects that are monitored by multisensor systems, rather than just their states at specific points in time. In order to infer environmental behaviours, it may be necessary to fuse data acquired from (i) geographically distributed sensors at specific points of time and (ii) specific sensors over a period of time. Fusing multisensor data over a period of time (also known as Temporal fusion) is a challenging task, since the data to be fused consists of complex sequences that are multi-dimensional, multimodal, interacting, and time-varying in nature. Additionally, performing temporal fusion efficiently in real-time is another challenge due to the large amounts of data to be fused. To address this issue, we propose a robust and efficient framework that uses dynamic time warping (DTW) as the core recognizer to perform online temporal fusion on either the raw data or the features. We evaluate the performance of the online temporal fusion system on two real world datasets: (1) accelerometer data acquired from performing two hand gestures, and (2) a benchmark dataset acquired from carrying a mobile device and performing the predefined user scenarios. Performance results of the DTW-based system are compared with those of a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) based system. The experimental results from both datasets demonstrate that the proposed system outperforms HMM based systems, and has the capability to perform online temporal fusion efficiently and accurately in real-time.},

Social, spatial, and informational considerations have a salient impact on such modern collaborative spaces. The design, implementation, and evaluation of a collaborative workspace prototype that directly supports the integrated use of mobile devices not only yields insights into the basic capabilities behind such a space, but also a deeper understanding of the different composition control mechanisms available. Specifically, such environments can effectively work with existing laptop platforms, and show increased promise for supporting future generations of smaller mobile devices.},

@article{Anonymous:2011ct,
  abstract = {Unexploded landmines have severe post-conflict humanitarian repercussions: landmines cost lives, limbs and land. For deminers engaged in humanitarian landmine clearance, metal detectors remain the primary detection tool as more sophisticated technologies fail to get adopted due to restrictive cost, low reliability, and limited robustness. Metal detectors are, however, of limited effectiveness, as modern landmines contain only minimal amounts of metal, making them difficult to distinguish from the ubiquitous but harmless metallic clutter littering post-combat areas. We seek to improve the safety and efficiency of the demining process by developing support tools that will enable deminers to make better decisions using feedback from existing metal detectors. To this end, in this paper we propose and evaluate a novel, pattern-based visual support approach inspired by the documented strategies employed by expert deminers. In our laboratory study, participants provided with a prototype of our support tool were 80\% less likely to mistake a mine for harmless clutter.

  abstract = {Interactive behavior is constrained by the design of the artifacts available (e.g., a mouse and button) as well as by the ways in which elementary cognitive, perceptual, and motor operations can be combined. Any 2 basic activities, for example, (a) moving to and (b) clicking on a button, can be combined to yield a limited number of microstrategies. The results of an experimental study suggest that alternative microstrategies can be deployed that shave milliseconds from routine interactive behavior. Data from a usability study are used to explore the potential of microstrategies for (a) bracketing the range of individual performance, (b) profiling individual differences, and (c) diagnosing mismatches between expected and obtained performance. These 2 studies support the arguments that the microstrategies deployed can be sensitive to small features of an interface and that task analyses at the millisecond level can inform design.},

  abstract = {Abstract: In recent years, there has been a growing interest in constructing rich interactive entertainment and training experiences. As these experiences have grown in complexity, there has been a corresponding growing need for the development of robust technologies to shape and modify those experiences in reaction to the actions of human participants. One popular mechanism for addressing this need is through the use of a drama manager. A drama manager is a coordinator that tracks narrative progress in the environment and directs the roles and/or responses of objects and agents to achieve a specific narrative or training goal. In this paper, we provide a survey of recent advances in drama management technologies for interactive entertainment, and describe a set of desiderata for the qualitative analysis of such systems.},

The model makes use of a polynomial specification so as to allow for potential life-saving and life-taking effects of cell phones. The results indicate that when cell phones were first introduced they had an adverse effect on pedestrian safety, but after a critical number of cell phones was reached, the life-saving effect dominated over the life-taking effect. However, as the number of phones continued to increase, the life-taking effect once again dominated over the life-saving effects.},

  abstract = {A problem faced by groups that are not co-located but need to collaborate on a common task is the reduced access to the rich multimodal communicative context that they would have access to if they were collaborating face-to-face. Collaboration support tools aim to reduce the adverse effects of this restricted access to the fluid intermixing of speech, gesturing, writing and sketching by providing mechanisms to enhance the awareness of distributed participants of each others' actions.In this work we explore novel ways to leverage the capabilities of multimodal context-aware systems to bridge co-located and distributed collaboration contexts. We describe a system that allows participants at remote sites to collaborate in building a project schedule via sketching on multiple distributed whiteboards, and show how participants can be made aware of naturally occurring pointing gestures that reference diagram constituents as they are performed by remote participants.The system explores the multimodal fusion of pen, speech and 3D gestures, coupled to the dynamic construction of a semantic representation of the interaction, anchored on the sketched diagram, to provide feedback that overcomes some of the intrinsic ambiguities of pointing gestures.},

  abstract = {Bone conducted chewing sounds picked up by a specially designed device were recorded from three different facial bony locations in two age and sex matched groups of subjects with natural and artificial dentitions. Frequency spectrographic analysis revealed that, although the sounds were louder in subjects with natural dentition, crisp and soggy textures could be equally well differentiated by their noise levels in both groups. The use of a denture adhesive restored the chewing noise of denture wearers to that observed in the natural dentition group. There was a marked degree of me- chanical impedance in the transmission of sound from the site of masticatory impact to distant cranial points. Breakdown of particle size during chewing was accompanied by declines in noise levels.},

@article{Sasai:2013ic,
  abstract = {The purpose of this study was to evaluate the Fast Fourie Transform (FFT)analysis of the occlusal sounds generated by tooth tapping which may apply in assisting in the functional diagnosis of occlusion in children. The fifteen subjects examined were devided into three groups: the first group with deciduous dentition, the second with mixed dentition and the third with permanent dentition. Occlusal sounds generated by tooth tapping at the rate of 76 times per minute were obtained with a micro-electronic condencer microphone placed on the infra-orbital region. For the time wave, the wave pattern of the occlusal sound was classified into two groups:1) Impact sound,2) Slide sound, and the ratio of appearance was examined. For the spectrum, three parameters were chosen for the measuring points such as 1) frequency range,2) peak frequency,3) strength of the peak frequency. The results obtained in the present study were summarized as follows: 1) Occlusal sounds in the deciduous dentition, the appearance of sliding sound was noticed in over 50\% of the cases while on the permanent dentition, the sliding sound was dominant. 2) The power spectrum of the occlusal sound showed generally two or three peaks. 3) The range of frequency was recognized to be extended on the sliding sound when compared with the impact sound.},

However, it has not led to algorithms that can scale to the increasingly massive datasets encountered in science, engineering, and business domains. In this work, we show how a novel multiresolution symbolic representation can be used to index datasets which are several orders of magnitude larger than anything else considered in the literature. Our approach allows both fast exact search and ultra fast approximate search. We show how to exploit the combination of both types of search as sub-routines in data mining algorithms, allowing for the exact mining of truly massive real world datasets, containing millions of time series.},

  abstract = {Public transit systems play an important role in combating traffic congestion, reducing carbon emissions, and promoting compact, sustainable urban communities. The usability of public transit can be significantly enhanced by providing good traveler information systems. We describe OneBusAway, a set of transit tools focused on providing real-time arrival information for Seattle-area bus riders. We then present results from a survey of OneBusAway users that show a set of important positive outcomes: strongly increased overall satisfaction with public transit, decreased waiting time, increased transit trips per week, increased feelings of safety, and even a health benefit in terms of increased distance walked when using transit. Finally, we discuss the design and policy implications of these results and plans for future research in this area.},

  abstract = {This paper describes the use of wearable sensor technology to control parameters of audio effects for real- time musical signal processing. Traditional instrument performance techniques are preserved while the system modifies the resulting sound based upon the movements of the performer. Gesture data from a performing artist is captured using three-axis accelerometer packages that is converted to MIDI (musical instrument digital interface) messages using microcontroller technology. ChucK, a new programming language for on-the-fly audio signal processing and sound synthesis, is used to collect and process synchronized gesture data and audio signals from the traditional instrument being performed. Case studies using the wearable sensors in a variety of locations on the body (head, hands, feet, etc.) with a number of different traditional instruments (tabla, sitar, drumset, turntables, etc.) are presented.},

  abstract = {If a device can control human hands, the device can be useful for HCI and tangible application's output. To aid the controlling of finger movement, we present PossessedHand, a device with a forearm belt that can inform when and which fingers should be moved. PossessedHand controls the user's fingers by applying electrical stimulus to the muscles around the forearm. Each muscle is stimulated via 28 electrode pads. Muscles at different depths in the forearm can be selected for simulation by varying the stimulation level. PossessedHand can automatically calibrate the system for individuals. The automatic calibration system estimates relations between each electrode pad, stimulation level and muscle movement.  Experiments show that PossessedHand can control the motion of 16 joints in the hand. Further, we also discuss an application based on this device to aid inplaying a musical instrument.},

Although the HMD can display information without interfering with the user's view, the displayed information is difficult to see when the HMD background is too complex or too bright. We have created an information layout method for the optical see-through HMD that takes the background into account. It determines the ideal area for displaying objects by evaluating the HMD background captured by a camera.},

We explore the use of planar sections, ie, the contours of intersection of planes with a 3D object, for creating shape abstractions, motivated by their popularity in art and engineering. We first perform a user study to show that humans do define consistent and similar planar section proxies for common objects. Interestingly, we observe a strong correlation between \ldots{}},

  abstract = {Design for (every)one is a macro framework that attempts to identify, share and use hidden solutions in community-based rehabilitation contexts and translate them into disruptive assistive devices built with local resources or appropriate technology. Within healthcare contexts, local solutions are frequently more effective as they reflect the physical, emotional and cognitive needs of specific patients and engage all stakeholders in a specific local context. By using open horizontal innovation networks, where assistive devices can be easily shared and physically hacked by other allied health professionals, general patterns can be detected and translated into standard universal design objects. This generative design thinking approach is more than feasible with digital trends such as crowd sourcing, user-generated content and peer production. Cheap and powerful prototyping tools have become easier to use by non-engineers; it turns them into users as well as self-manufacturers of their personal assistive a...},

We present a middleware infrastructure, called MobiGo, that provides seamless mobility of services among these environments. We identify three different kinds of environments (spaces)\textendash{} self-owned, familiar, and totally-new and three axes for supporting mobility, namely, hard state, soft state, and I/O state in these spaces. MobiGo provides the architectural elements for efficiently managing these different states in the different spaces. Focusing on a specific demanding video service, we describe an implementation and performance results that show that MobiGo enhances user experience for seamless mobility.},

  abstract = {Event sequence analysis is an important task in many domains: medical researchers may study the patterns of transfers within the hospital for quality control; transportation experts may study accident response logs to identify best practices. In many cases they deal with thousands of records. While previous research has focused on searching and browsing, overview tasks are often overlooked. We introduce a novel interactive visual overview of event sequences called LifeFlow. LifeFlow is scalable, can summarize all possible sequences, and represents the temporal spacing of the events within sequences. Two case studies with healthcare and transportation domain experts are presented to illustrate the usefulness of LifeFlow. A user study with ten participants confirmed that after 15 minutes of training novice users were  able to rapidly answer questions about the prevalence and temporal characteristics  of sequences, find anomalies, and gain significant insight from the data.},

  abstract = {Current cell phone designs are limited by the information a caller can provide to the receiver at the time of a call. As a result callers are handicapped in effectively negotiating interaction commitment from the receiver, and perhaps more importantly, receivers are unable to make informed call handling decisions. To examine the nature of this information gap we 1) developed Telling Calls, a mobile phone application which allows users to provide and receive information such as what the call is about and the circumstances of the caller under which it is being made, and 2) conducted a qualitative field study (36 users) and a quantitative field study (30 users) of Telling Calls use. Together these studies provide insights on how additional caller generated information shared at the time of call handling effectively improves the process of negotiating interaction commitment, and establishing common ground.},

Human-computer interaction (HCI) researchers have recently designed systems to support diet and exercise, but sleep has been relatively under-studied in the HCI community. We conducted a literature review and formative study aimed at uncovering opportunities for computing to support the important area of promoting healthy sleep. We present results from interviews with sleep experts, as well as a survey (N = 230) and interviews with potential users (N = 16) to indicate what people would find practical and useful for sleep. Based on these results, we identify a number of design considerations, challenges, and opportunities for using computing to support healthy sleep behaviors, as well as a design framework for mapping the design space of technologies for sleep.},

  abstract = {Existing gesture-recognition systems consume signifi- cant power and computational resources that limit how they may be used in low-end devices. We introduce AllSee, the first gesture-recognition system that can op- erate on a range of computing devices including those with no batteries. AllSee consumes three to four or- ders of magnitude lower power than state-of-the-art sys- tems and can enable always-on gesture recognition for smartphones and tablets. It extracts gesture information from existing wireless signals (e.g., TV transmissions), but does not incur the power and computational over- heads of prior wireless approaches. We build AllSee prototypes that can recognize gestures on RFID tags and power-harvesting sensors. We also integrate our hard- ware with an off-the-shelf Nexus S phone and demon- strate gesture recognition in through-the-pocket scenar- ios. Our results show that AllSee achieves classification accuracies as high as 97\% over a set of eight gestures.},

@article{Sung:2010p8776,
  abstract = {With the help of virtualization and cloud technologies [1, 2], users desktop service can be made available on internet or local area network. This service is called virtual desktop or desktop cloud. However, user interface is limited to I/O capabilities of a users mobile terminal. In order to enhance user interface in remote virtualized desktop, it is important to take advantage of fullfeatured I/O devices found locally. Our previous work called SoD (System-onDemand) [3, 4] proposed how to associate local I/O devices with remote virtualized desktop in Xen [5]. It is required to install SoD client agent in a users mobile terminal. In this paper, we propose a new framework called WebSoD that does not require any explicit installation to make SoD service available in virtual desktop. In the Web-SoD, the SoD service is provided by the web technology so that the SoD client agent can be installed transparently, and platform independency is also achieved. For this purpose, we extend Native Client (NaCl) proposed by Google [6] to support networking by modifying NaCl compiler, library and service runtime. By the proposed Web-SoD framework, it is possible for local I/O devices to be available remotely via Web interface \textendash{} transforming local legacy I/O devices into network-wide I/O devices. Then, a user can dynamically configure the network-wide I/O devices to the virtual desktop in order to get better user interface. In addition, it is possible to eliminate an explicit installation of complex agents.},

  abstract = {ABSTRACT Most studies on tangible user interfaces for the tabletop design systems are being undertaken from a technology viewpoint. Although there have been studies that focus on the development of new interactive environments employing tangible user interfaces for designers, there is a lack of evaluation with respect to designers' spatial cognition. In this research we study the effects of tangible user interfaces on designers' spatial cognition to provide empirical evidence for the anecdotal views of the effect of tangible user interfaces. To highlight the expected changes in spatial cognition while using tangible user interfaces, we compared designers using a tangible user interface on a tabletop system with 3D blocks to designers using a graphical user interface on a desktop computer with a mouse and keyboard. The ways in which designers use the two different interfaces for 3D design were examined using a protocol analysis method. The result reveals that designers using 3D blocks perceived more spatia...},

@article{Hummels:2007p1206,
  abstract = {The world is inherently meaningful for us, i.e. we perceive the world in terms of what we can do with it, and by physically interacting with it we access this meaning and express the meaning. We believe that this is the core reason and foundation for turning to movement-based interaction. `Interaction creates meaning' does not only hold for users during interaction but also for designers when generating ideas and developing concepts. Therefore, we postulate that if one truly likes to design for movement-based interaction, one has to be or become an expert in movement, not just theoretically, by imagination or on paper, but by doing and experiencing while designing. In order to do so, we believe that designers need design tools, techniques, knowledge, awareness and skills that support their search for expressive, rich behaviour. Our search for this support resulted in several methods, tools and knowledge that help designers exploring, visualising and reflecting on interactions. Our developed methods and tools such as the Design Movement approach with its choreography of interaction, gestural design tools, interactive installations and interactive tangible sketching, have not only supported and inspired designers to design for movement-based interaction, but also resulted in surprising, fresh designs in comparison with the limited scope of rather uniform and traditional electronic consumer products. This paper discusses the possibilities and limitations of our approach.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we discuss a new user interface, a complementary environment for the work with personal document archives, i.e. for document filing and retrieval. We introduce our implementation of a spatial medium for document interaction, explorative search and active navigation, which exploits and further stimulates the human strengths of visual information processing. Our system achieves a high degree of immersion of the user, so that he/she forgets the artificiality of his/her environment. This is done by means of a tripartite ensemble of allowing users to interact naturally with gestures and postures (as an option gestures and postures can be individually taught to the system by users), exploiting 3D technology, and supporting the user to maintain structures he/she discovers, as well as provide computer calculated semantic structures. Our ongoing evaluation shows that even non-expert users can efficiently work with the information in a document collection, and have fun.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we introduce a novel wearable electrode for an intra-body area network (I-BAN) by employing the advantages of polyimide (PI) which is a well-known substrate material for flexible electrodes and polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) which is a biocompatible and representative soft-lithography adaptable material. Electrodes were patterned onto thin and flexible PI substrates and encapsulated in PDMS to enhance skin compatibility. For this purpose, we developed an electrode fabrication process on thin PI substrates and a PDMS encapsulation technique by bonding two PDMS layers on the front and back surfaces of the PI electrode. The mechanical property and communication performance of electrodes were characterized through spectrum analysis to optimize the role as an I-BAN electrode. Skin-compatibility and cyto-toxicity tests using human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) were carried out to demonstrate the non-toxicity of the electrode after continuous wearing. Sinusoidal signals of 45 MHz were successfully transmitted with high fidelity between electrodes separated by 30 cm.},

  abstract = {We all spend time every day looking for information in our email, yet we know little about this refinding process. Some users expend considerable preparatory effort creating complex folder structures to promote effective refinding. However modern email clients provide alternative opportunistic methods for access, such as search and threading, that promise to reduce the need to manually prepare. To compare these different refinding strategies, we instrumented a modern email client that supports search, folders, tagging and threading. We carried out a field study of 345 long-term users who conducted over 85,000 refinding actions. Our data support opportunistic access. People who create complex folders indeed rely on these for retrieval, but these preparatory behaviors are inefficient and do not improve retrieval success. In contrast, both search and threading promote more effective finding. We present design implications: current search-based clients ignore scrolling, the most prevalent refinding behavior, and threading approaches need to be extended.},

The body antenna effect which interferes with signals in the human body channel is examined. The body-induced interferences degrade the SIR of the signal to -22 dB in the worst case. In order to overcome the body antenna effect, a 4-channel adaptive frequency hopping scheme using the 30-120 MHz band is introduced to the body channel transceiver. A direct-switching modulator using dual frequency synthesizers and a DLL-based demodulator are proposed for 10 Mb/s FSK and the 4.2 mus hopping time. The transceiver fabricated with 0.18 mum CMOS withstands -28 dB SIR and its operating distance is over 1.8 m with - 25 dB SIR. Its energy consumption is 0.37 nJ/b with -65 dBm sensitivity.},

Most of the models are specific to a technology or fail to account for human factors and variations in system parameters, and the relationship between them. Moreover, the process of fixing errors and its effects on text entry performance has not been studied. Here, we first analyze real-life text entry error correction behaviors. We then use our findings to develop a new model to predict the cost of error correction for character-based text entry technologies. We validate our model against quantities derived from the literature, as well as with a user study. Our study shows that the predicted and observed costs of error correction correspond well. At the end, we discuss potential applications of our new model.},

@article{Latoschik:2005p1299,
  abstract = {This article presents a User Interface (UI) framework for multimodal interactions targeted at immersive virtual environments. Its configurable input and gesture processing components provide an advanced behavior graph capable of routing continuous data streams asynchronously. The framework introduces a Knowledge Representation Layer which augments objects of the simulated environment with Semantic Entities as a central object model that bridges and interfaces Virtual Reality (VR) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) representations. Specialized node types use these facilities to implement required processing tasks like gesture detection, preprocessing of the visual scene for multimodal integration, or translation of movements into multimodally initialized gestural interactions. A modified Augmented Transition Nettwork (ATN) approach accesses the knowledge layer as well as the preprocessing components to integrate linguistic, gestural, and context information in parallel. The overall framework emphasizes extensibility, adaptivity and reusability, e.g., by utilizing persistent and interchangeable XML-based formats to describe its processing stages.},

Most of the literature on time-series data visualization either focus on a small number of tasks or a specific domain. We propose KronoMiner, a tool that embeds new interaction and visualization techniques as well as analytical capabilities for the visual exploration of time-series data. The interface's design has been iteratively refined based on feedback from expert users. Qualitative evaluation with an expert user not involved in the design process indicates that our prototype is promising for further research.},

These user interfaces allow independent control of translations, rotations, and scaling for manipulation of 3D objects. In this paper, we study how these widgets can be adapted to the tactile paradigm. We have explored an approach where users apply rotations by means of physically plausible gestures, and we have extended successful 2D tactile principles to the context of 3D interaction. These investigations led to the design of a new 3D transformation widget, tBox, that can been operated easily and efficiently from gestures on touch-screens.},

  abstract = {In this paper we suggest the use of tangible user interfaces (TUIs) for human-robot interaction (HRI) applications. We discuss the potential benefits of this approach while focusing on low-level of autonomy tasks. We present an experimental robotic interaction test bed to support our investigation. We use the test bed to explore two HRI related task-sets: robotic navigation control and robotic posture control. We discuss the implementation of these two task-sets using an AIBO\texttrademark{} robot dog. Both tasks were mapped to two different robotic control interfaces: keypad interface which resembles the interaction approach currently common in HRI, and a gesture input mechanism based on Nintendo Wii\texttrademark{} game controllers. We discuss the interfaces implementation and conclude with a detailed user study for evaluating these different HRI techniques in the two robotic tasks-sets.},

Applying real time camera tracking, and high-level automated image analysis, enables more powerful modelling interactions than have previously been possible. The result is an immersive modelling process which generates accurate three dimensional models of real objects efficiently and effectively. In demonstrating the modelling process on a range of indoor and outdoor scenes, we show the flexibility it offers in enabling augmented reality applications in previously unseen environments},

  abstract = {Few research studies focus on how the use of assistive technologies is affected by social interaction among people. We present an interview study of 20 individuals to determine how assistive technology use is affected by social and professional contexts and interactions. We found that specific assistive devices sometimes marked their users as having disabilities; that functional access took priority over feeling self-conscious when using assistive technologies; and that two misperceptions pervaded assistive technology use: (1) that assistive devices could functionally eliminate a disability, and (2) that people with disabilities would be helpless without their devices. Our findings provide further evidence that accessibility should be built into mainstream technologies. When this is not feasible, assistive devices should incorporate cutting edge technologies and strive to be designed for social acceptability, a new design approach we propose here.},

  abstract = {ABSTRACT This article focuses on our exploration of awareness issues through the design and long-term deployment of two systems: the Hermes office door display system (which enabled staff in a university department to post awareness messages to their door displays) and SPAM (a messaging system for supporting coordination between staff at two associated residential community care facilities). In the case of both systems, a significant number of the messages sent could be classified as relating to awareness. Furthermore, with both systems, the situatedness of displays (outside office doors in the case of Hermes and in staff offices in the case of SPAM) had a significant impact on the design and subsequent use of the deployed systems. In particular, the placement of displays provided significant context for awareness messages, including, for example, the identity of the sender of the message and the intended audience of the message. Both systems highlight the need for interaction methods that fit in with bot...},

  abstract = {Man-computer symbiosis is an expected development in cooperative interaction between men and electronic computers. It will involve very close coupling between the human and the electronic members of the partnership. The main aims are 1) to let computers facilitate formulative thinking as they now facilitate the solution of formulated problems, and 2) to enable men and computers to cooperate in making decisions and controlling complex situations without inflexible dependence on predetermined programs. In the anticipated symbiotic partnership, men will set the goals, formulate the hypotheses, determine the criteria, and perform the evaluations. Computing machines will do the routinizable work that must be done to prepare the way for insights and decisions in technical and scientific thinking. Preliminary analyses indicate that the symbiotic partnership will perform intellectual operations much more effectively than man alone can perform them. Prerequisites for the achievement of the effective, cooperative association include developments in computer time sharing, in memory components, in memory organization, in programming languages, and in input and output equipment.},

@article{Oulasvirta:2008p5042,
  abstract = {This paper considers how we may design future mobile awareness systems. Building upon research on social cognition, we suggest the need to take into account what is known about humans' interpretational capabilities. We identify design issues from the level of an individual awareness cue to the level of a product concept, systematically exposing the associated solution spaces. Using four real applications as analytical examples, we point out multiple ways in which design can affect the user's processing of awareness information and thereby yield different outcomes in the use of technology. We conclude by pointing out novel design opportunities that lie in the integration of cues with functionality and content on the mobile phone.},

Using electromagnetic actuation, we manipulate attributes of tangibles on the fly, such as perceived weight, spring resistance, friction, and latching. We describe our actuation concepts, prototypes, and measurements showing that magnetic fields can change physical effects in a linear way. Controlled experiments reveal that participants can tactually distinguish four rendered resistance levels of a button prototype and easily detect dynamic detents in a continuous slider. Finally, we describe how adjustable physical properties in tangibles can enhance tabletop interaction.},

  abstract = {In this paper we argue that Musicons, short samples from pieces of music are a useful way to present private but memorable reminder messages. We investigated accuracy, memorability and response times for short, medium, and long Musicons. User performance on the Musicons was also compared to short spoken reminders. The study consisted of two sessions a week apart. Quantitative measures were augmented with qualitative questions about associations and memories. Overall, participants achieved a high level of accuracy (89\%) on the Musicons. Recognition was stable at 90\% or better across sessions for users who were able to construct meaningful links between Musicons and the associated tasks. Optimal response times were achieved for medium-length 0.5 sec. Musicons. We conclude that Musicons are a viable option for alarms and notifications that combine the high learnability of Auditory Icons with the more private nature of Earcons.},

  abstract = {While mobile computing provides organizations with many information systems implementation alternatives, it is often difficult to predict the potential benefits, limitations, and problems with mobile applications. Given the inherent portability of mobile devices, many design and use issues can arise which do not exist with desktop systems. While many existing rules of thumb for design of stationary systems apply to mobile systems, many new ones emerge. Issues such as the security and privacy of information take on new dimensions, and potential conflicts can develop when a single mobile device serves both personal and business needs. This paper identifies potential issues and problems with the use of mobile information systems by examining both personal and organizational perspectives of mobile devices and applications. It provides a set of guidelines that can assist organizations in making decisions about the design and implementation of mobile technologies and applications in organizations.},

  abstract = {People sometimes miss small parts of meetings and need to quickly catch up without disrupting the rest of the meeting. We developed an Accelerated Instant Replay (AIR) Conferencing system for videoconferencing that enables users to catch up on missed content while the meeting is ongoing. AIR can replay parts of the conference using four different modalities: audio, video, conversation transcript, and shared workspace. We performed two studies to evaluate the system. The first study explored the benefit of AIR catch-up during a live meeting. The results showed that when the full videoconference was reviewed (i.e., all four modalities) at an accelerated rate, users were able to correctly recall a similar amount of information as when listening live. To better understand the benefit of full review, a follow-up study more closely examined the benefits of each of the individual modalities. The results show that users (a) preferred using audio along with any other modality to using audio alone, (b) were most confident and performed best when audio was reviewed with all other modalities, (c) compared to audio-only, had better recall of facts and explanations when reviewing audio together with the shared workspace and transcript modalities, respectively, and (d) performed similarly with audio-only and audio with video review.},

@phdthesis{Korishe:vi,
  abstract = {The main concept of Body-Coupled Communication (BCC) is to transmit the electrical information through the human body as a communication medium by means of capacitive coupling. Nowadays the current research of wireless body area network are expanding more with the new ideas and topologies for better result in respect to the low power and area, security, reliability and sensitivity since it is first introduced by the Zimmerman in 1995. In contrast with the other existing wireless communication technology such as WiFi, Bluetooth and Zigbee, the BCC is going to increase the number of applications as well as solves the problem with the cell based communication system depending upon the frequency allocation. In addition, this promising technology has been standardized by a task group named IEEE 802.15.6 addressing a reliable and feasible system for low power in-body and on-body nodes that serves a variety of medical and non medical applications. The entire BAN project is divided into three major parts consisting of application layer, digital baseband and analog front end (AFE) transceiver. In the thesis work a strong driver circuit for BCC is implemented as an analog front end transmitter (Tx). The primary purpose of the study is to transmit a strong signal as the signal is attenuated by the body around 60 dB. The Driver circuit is cascaded of two single-stage inverter and an identical inverter with drain resistor. The entire driver circuit is designed with ST65 nm CMOS technology with 1.2 V supply operated at 10 MHz frequency, has a driving capability of 6 mA which is the basic requirement. The performance of the transmitter is compared with the other architecture by integrating different analysis such as corner analysis, noise analysis and eye diagram. The cycle to cycle jitter is 0.87\% which is well below to the maximum point and the power supply rejection ratio (PSRR) is 65 dB indicates the good emission of supply noise. In addition, the transmitter does not require a filter to emit the noise because the body acts like a low pass filter. In conclusion the findings of the thesis work is quite healthy compared to the previous work. Finally, there is some point to improve for the driver circuit in respect to the power consumption, propagation delay and leakage power in the future.},

@inproceedings{Bastian:2010gj,
  abstract = {We present a method for estimating the 3D shape of an object from a sequence of images captured by a hand-held device. The method is well suited to augmented reality applications in that minimal user interaction is required, and the models generated are of an appropriate form. The method proceeds by segmenting the object in every image as it is captured and using the calculated silhouette to update the current shape estimate. In contrast to previous silhouette-based modelling approaches, however, the segmentation process is informed by a 3D prior based on the previous shape estimate. A voting scheme is also introduced in order to compensate for the inevitable noise in the camera position estimates. The combination of the voting scheme with the closed-loop segmentation process provides a robust and flexible shape estimation method. We demonstrate the approach on a number of scenes where segmentation without a 3D prior would be challenging},

  abstract = {As HCI is applied in increasingly diverse contexts, it is important to consider situations in which computational or information technologies may be less appropriate. This paper presents a series of questions that can help researchers, designers, and practitioners articulate a technology's appropriateness or inappropriateness. Use of these questions is demonstrated via examples from the literature. The paper concludes with specific arguments for improving the conduct of HCI. This paper provides a means for understanding and articulating the limits of HCI technologies, an important but heretofore under-explored contribution to the field.},

  abstract = {Since we started carrying mobiles phones, they have altered the ways in which we orient our bodies in the world. Many of those changes are invisible to us \textendash{} they have become habits, deeply engrained in our society. To make us more aware of our bodily ways of living with mobiles and open the design space for novel ways of designing mobiles and their interactions, we decided to study one of the last groups of users on earth who had not been exposed to mobiles: the people of Vanuatu. As they had so recently started using mobiles, their use was still in flux: the fragility of the mobile was unusual to them as was the need to move in order to find coverage. They were still getting used to carrying their mobiles and keeping them safe. Their encounters with mobile use exposed the need to consider somaesthetics practices when designing mobiles as they profoundly affect our bodily ways of being in the world.},

@article{Kane:2008p5077,
  abstract = {Using a mobile device while moving limits attention and motor ability and can result in reduced performance. Mobile devices that can sense and adapt to contextual factors such as movement may reduce this performance deficit. We performed two studies evaluating the feasibility of walking user interfaces (WUIs) that adapt their layout when the user is moving. In a pilot study with 6 users, we evaluated the effects of different button sizes on performance when walking while using a portable music player. Results showed significant interactions between size and movement. In the second study, 29 users evaluated the performance of a WUI that dynamically changed button sizes as the user moved. Results show that our dynamic user interface performs at the level of its component static interfaces without any additional penalty due to adaptation. This work adds to our design knowledge about walking user interfaces and provides lessons learned in evaluating mobile devices while walking in public spaces.},

@article{Wolff:1990id,
  abstract = {A computationally simple yet powerful method for distinguishing metal and dielectric material surfaces from the polarization characteristics of specularly reflected light is introduced. The method is completely passive, requiring only the sensing of transmitted radiance of reflected light through a polarizing filter positioned in multiple orientations in front of a camera sensor. Precise positioning of lighting is not required. An advantage of using a polarization-based method for material classification is its immunity to color variations, which so commonly exist on uniform material samples. A simple polarization-reflectance model, called the Fresnel reflectance model, is developed. The fundamental assumptions are that the diffuse component of reflection is completely unpolarized and that the polarization state of the specular component of reflection is dictated by the Fresnel reflection coefficients. The material classification method presented results axiomatically from the Fresnel reflectance model, by estimating the polarization Fresnel ratio. No assumptions are required about the functional form of the diffuse and specular components of reflection. The method is demonstrated on some common objects consisting of metal and dielectric parts},

  abstract = {Hypothesis:~An inexpensive temporal bone model for use in a temporal bone dissection laboratory setting can be made using a commercially available, consumer-grade 3D printer.
        Background:~Several models for a simulated temporal bone have been described but use commercial-grade printers and materials to produce these models. The goal of this project was to produce a plastic simulated temporal bone on an inexpensive 3D printer that recreates the visual and haptic experience associated with drilling a human temporal bone.
        Methods:~Images from a high-resolution CT of a normal temporal bone were converted into stereolithography files via commercially available software, with image conversion and print settings adjusted to achieve optimal print quality. The temporal bone model was printed using acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) plastic filament on a MakerBot 2x 3D printer. Simulated temporal bones were drilled by seven expert temporal bone surgeons, assessing the fidelity of the model as compared with a human cadaveric temporal bone. Using a four-point scale, the simulated bones were assessed for haptic experience and recreation of the temporal bone anatomy.
        Results:~The created model was felt to be an accurate representation of a human temporal bone. All raters felt strongly this would be a good training model for junior residents or to simulate difficult surgical anatomy. Material cost for each model was \$1.92.
        Conclusions:~A realistic, inexpensive, and easily reproducible temporal bone model can be created on a consumer-grade desktop 3D printer.},

  abstract = {Background:The current educational approach for teaching congenital heart disease (CHD) anatomy to students involves instructional tools and techniques that have significant limitations. This study sought to assess the feasibility of utilizing present-day three-dimensional (3D) printing technology to create high-fidelity synthetic heart models with ventricular septal defect (VSD) lesions and applying these models to a novel, simulation-based educational curriculum for premedical and medical students.Methods:Archived, de-identified magnetic resonance images of five common VSD subtypes were obtained. These cardiac images were then segmented and built into 3D computer-aided design models using Mimics Innovation Suite software. An Objet500 Connex 3D printer was subsequently utilized to print a high-fidelity heart model for each VSD subtype. Next, a simulation-based educational curriculum using these heart models was developed and implemented in the instruction of 29 premedical and medical students. Assessment of this curriculum was undertaken with Likert-type questionnaires.Results:High-fidelity VSD models were successfully created utilizing magnetic resonance imaging data and 3D printing. Following instruction with these high-fidelity models, all students reported significant improvement in knowledge acquisition (P {$<$} .0001), knowledge reporting (P {$<$} .0001), and structural conceptualization (P {$<$} .0001) of VSDs.Conclusions:It is feasible to use present-day 3D printing technology to create high-fidelity heart models with complex intracardiac defects. Furthermore, this tool forms the foundation for an innovative, simulation-based educational approach to teach students about CHD and creates a novel opportunity to stimulate their interest in this field.},

  abstract = {Information visualization has often focused on providing deep insight for expert user populations and on techniques for amplifying cognition through complicated interactive visual models. This paper proposes a new subdomain for infovis research that complements the focus on analytic tasks and expert use. Instead of work-related and analytically driven infovis, we propose casual information visualization (or casual infovis) as a complement to more traditional infovis domains. Traditional infovis systems, techniques, and methods do not easily lend themselves to the broad range of user populations, from expert to novices, or from work tasks to more everyday situations. We propose definitions, perspectives, and research directions for further investigations of this emerging subfield. These perspectives build from ambient information visualization (Skog et al., 2003), social visualization, and also from artistic work that visualizes information (Viegas and Wattenberg, 2007). We seek to provide a perspective on infovis that integrates these research agendas under a coherent vocabulary and framework for design. We enumerate the following contributions. First, we demonstrate how blurry the boundary of infovis is by examining systems that exhibit many of the putative properties of infovis systems, but perhaps would not be considered so. Second, we explore the notion of insight and how, instead of a monolithic definition of insight, there may be multiple types, each with particular characteristics. Third, we discuss design challenges for systems intended for casual audiences. Finally we conclude with challenges for system evaluation in this emerging subfield.},

Three-dimensional printing technology is used to create a physical representation of data. The object is then used as a tangible input prop, which exactly matches the data. In addition, two-handed interaction with a stylus is performed on the prop without the use of buttons, instead relying on the detection of contact between the stylus and the prop through precise calibration and tracking. This allows the sense of touch to be harnessed to create a more efficient and natural interaction method for scientific visualizations in virtual and augmented reality. We explain the concept of tangible props and where it can be applied. We also consider the technical requirements of systems using such props. Finally, we present our example application, which uses printed tangible props for interactive measurement of marine coral data. The use of tangible props is found to improve the usability of the application.},

Holding a physical rapid prototype model in one's hand can provide an immediate and more accurate understanding of a complex 3D form than can be provided via a computer display, even a head-tracked VR display. However, physical printouts are static and only show the bounding surface (the outside) of a 3D geometry. When working with many of today's scientific datasets, for example, analyzing results of high-performance simulations of cardiovascular fluid dynamics [Simon et al. 2010], scientists need to understand both a complex bounding surface for the data and multivariate volumetric data contained within it. We present the initial design of a new interface for exploring this type of data. Our goal is to combine the intuitive shape understanding made possible by physical 3D rapid prototypes with complementary VR visualizations of the data inside the printed geometry.},

To address this, researchers have design interactive 3D printed models (I3Ms) that provide audio descriptions when a user touches components of a model. In prior work, I3Ms were designed on an ad hoc basis, and it is currently unknown what general guidelines produce effective I3M designs. To address this gap, we conducted two studies with Teachers of the Visually Impaired (TVIs). First, we led two design workshops with 35 TVIs, who modified sample models and added interactive elements to them. Second, we worked with three TVIs to design three I3Ms in an iterative instructional design process. At the end of this process, the TVIs used the I3Ms we designed to teach their students. We conclude that I3Ms should (1) have effective tactile features (e.g., distinctive patterns between components), (2) contain both auditory and visual content (e.g., explanatory animations), and (3) consider pedagogical methods (e.g., overview before details).},

In general, they are too expensive to scale to large surfaces, such as walls and furniture, and cannot provide input on objects having irregular and complex geometries, such as tools and toys. We introduce Electrick, a low-cost and versatile sensing technique that enables touch input on a wide variety of objects and surfaces, whether small or large, flat or irregular. This is achieved by using electric field tomography in concert with an electrically conductive material, which can be easily and cheaply added to objects and surfaces. We show that our technique is compatible with commonplace manufacturing methods, such as spray/brush coating, vacuum forming, and casting/molding enabling a wide range of possible uses and outputs. Our technique can also bring touch interactivity to rapidly fabricated objects, including those that are laser cut or 3D printed. Through a series of studies and illustrative example uses, we show that Electrick can enable new interactive opportunities on a diverse set of objects and surfaces that were previously static.},

  abstract = {What are big questions? Why do scholars propose them? How are they generated? Could they be valuable and useful in HCI research? In this paper we conduct a thorough review of "big questions" literature, which draws on scholarship from a variety of fields and disciplines. Our intended contribution is twofold. First, we provide a substantive review of big questions scholarship, which to our knowledge has never been done before. Second, we leverage this summary as a means of examining the value and utility of big questions in HCI as a research discipline. Whether HCI decides that generating and having big questions would be a desirable path forward, we believe that examining the potential for big questions is a useful way of becoming more reflective about HCI research.},
