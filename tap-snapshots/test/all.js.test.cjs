          management. This book explores this relationship from different
          perspectives, illuminating the complexity of interactions between
          human societies and nature. Most of the contributors use the
          perspective of "political ecology" as a point of departure,
          recognizing that human relations to the environment and human social
          relations are not separate phenomena but inextricably intertwined.

      abstract:
        - "Logic of Sense is one of Deleuze's seminal works. First published in
          1969, shortly after Difference and Repetition, it prefigures the
          hybrid style and methods he would use in his later writing with Felix
          Guattari. In an early review Michel Foucault wrote that Logic of Sense
          'should be read as the boldest and most insolent of metaphysical
          treatises'. The book is divided into 34 'series' and five appendices
          covering a diverse range of topics including, sense, nonsense, event,
          sexuality, psychoanalysis, paradoxes, schizophrenia, literature and
          becoming and includes fascinating close textual readings of works by
          Lewis Carroll, Sigmund Freud, Seneca, Pierre Klossowski, F. Scott
          Fitzgerald, and Émile Zola. Logic of Sense is essential reading for
          anyone interested in post-war continental thought. Contents Preface:

        - "An ancient ethics for modern life - Develops an original ethics of
          motion for the 21st century from Lucretius' didactic poem De Rerum
          Natura - Argues uniquely that Lucretius had a distinct ethical theory

          for Lucretius I Human suffering, the fear of death, war, poverty,
          ecological destruction and social inequality: almost 2,000 ago
          Lucretius proposed an ethics of motion as simple and stunning solution
          to these ethical problems. Thomas Nail argues that Lucretius was the
          first to locate the core of all these ethical ills in our obsession
          with stasis, our fear of movement and our hatred of matter. Instead of
          trying to transcend nature with our minds, escape it with our immortal
          souls and dominate it with our technologies, Lucretius was perhaps the
          first in the Western tradition to forcefully argue for a completely
          materialist, immanent and naturalistic ethics based on moving well
          with and as nature. If we want to survive and live well on this
          planet, Lucretius taught us, our best chance is not to struggle
          against nature but to embrace it and facilitate its movement.
          Lucretius II is the second installment in Thomas Nail's transformative
          reading of Lucretius' didactic poem De Rerum Natura, which can be read
          individually or as a trilogy. Lucretius I covered books 1 and 2 of De
          Rerum Natura and looked at Lucretius' ontology; this volume covers
          books 3 and 4 and Lucretius' ethics. The third and final volume will
          cover books 5 and 6."

      abstract:
        - State planning has been a defining means for modern subjects to
          regulate the passage of time. In practice, it is the focus of multiple
          conflicts and doubts, which planners attempt to mediate. In this
          paper, I address the regimes of time that planning both promotes and
          encounters, and tease out what these imply for anthropology. Using
          ethnography of Norwegian and Swedish planning offices and their
          encounters with participatory planning, I question recent claims that
          there has been an evacuation of the near future or a retreat of
          administrative intervention. I also suggest that recent
          anthropological concerns with time have been confined by their
          attempts to characterize the changing timescapes of specific modal
          shifts, such as from the modern to the neoliberal. Instead, in my
          ethnography, I focus not on tracking epochal breaks in time, but on
          demonstrating how time is manipulated, and how multiple temporalities
          are performed in ongoing projects of democratic planning.

      abstract:
        - Probability has become one of the most characteristic con cepts of
          modern culture, and a 'probabilistic way of thinking' may be said to
          have penetrated almost every sector of our in tellectual life. However
          it would be difficult to determine an explicit list of 'positive'
          features, to be proposed as identifica tion marks of this way of
          thinking. One would rather say that it is characterized by certain
          'negative' features, i. e. by certain at titudes which appear to be
          the negation of well established tra ditional assumptions, conceptual
          frameworks, world outlooks and the like. It is because of this
          opposition to tradition that the probabilistic approach is perceived
          as expressing a 'modern' in tellectual style. As an example one could
          mention the widespread diffidence in philosophy with respect to self
          -contained systems claiming to express apodictic truths, instead of
          which much weaker pretensions are preferred, that express 'probable'
          interpretations of reality, of history, of man (the hermeneutic
          trend). An ana logous example is represented by the interest devoted
          to the study of different patterns of 'argumentation', dealing wiht
          reasonings which rely not so much on the truth of the premisses and
          stringent formal logic links, but on a display of contextual
          conditions (depending on the audience, and on accepted stan dards,
          judgements, and values), which render the premisses and the
          conclusions more 'probable' (the new rhetoric).

        - "During centuries physicists were supposed to be studying the physical
          world. Since the turn of the century this assumption has often been
          challenged as naive: it was proclaimed that physics is not about the
          external world but about observers and their manipulations: that it is
          meaningless to talk of anything else than observation devices and
          operations: that the laws of physics concern our knowledge rather than
          the external world."

      abstract:
        - The theory of evolution is too general to be able to make predictions.
          However, like every other hypergeneral scientific theory, it can be
          enriched with specific assumptions and data, and thus become a
          specific model for a particular evolutionary line. This paper exhibits
          such a model. It accounts for the evolution of a biopopulation in
          terms of genetic and environmental variables. The results is a system
          of linear finite difference equations that enable one to pin down the
          necessary and sufficient conditions for evolution proper to occur, as
          well as to predict the average numbers of the final varieties
          originating from the parent population. It is estimated that the main
          value of the paper is methodological rather than substantive, in that
          it suggests a way of building models of biological lineages.

      abstract:
        - The concept of probability has fascinated and puzzled numerous
          philosophers since its inception three and a half centuries ago.
          Mathematicians and scientists too, whether basic or applied, have
          often taken part in philosophical discussions on probability.
          Notwithstanding such discussions, which have been numerous and often
          spirited, there is still considerable divergence of opinion concerning
          the interpretation of probability. (See e.g. du Pasquier 1926, Fine
          1973.) This is probably due to the fact that the choice of
          interpretation is largely a matter of philosophy. Not that philosophy
          is necessarily inconclusive, but it does colour all thinking on
          fundamental questions.

      abstract:
        - Debates about scientific realism are centrally connected to
          almosteverything else in the philosophy of science, for they concern
          the verynature of scientific knowledge. Scientific realism is a
          positiveepistemic attitude towards the content of our best theories
          and models,recommending belief in both observable and unobservable
          aspects of theworld described by the sciences. This epistemic attitude
          has importantmetaphysical and semantic dimensions, and these various
          commitments arecontested by a number of rival epistemologies of
          science, knowncollectively as forms of scientific antirealism. This
          article explainswhat scientific realism is, outlines its main
          variants, considers themost common arguments for and against the
          position, and contrasts itwith its most important antirealist
          counterparts.

      abstract:
        - Abduction or, as it is also often called, Inference to the Best
          Explanation is a type of inference that assigns special status to
          explanatory considerations. Most philosophers agree that this type
          ofinference is frequently employed, in some form or other, both in
          everyday and in scientific reasoning. However, the exact form as
          wellas the normative status of abduction are still matters of
          controversy. This entry contrasts abduction with other types of
          inference; points at prominent uses of it, both in and outside
          philosophy; considers various more or less precise statements of it;
          discusses its normative status; and highlights possible connections
          between abduction and Bayesian confirmation theory.

      abstract:
        - Daniel Dennett's book, Darwin's Dangerous Idea, offers a naturalistic
          teleology and a theory of the intentionality of the mental. Both are
          grounded in a neo-Darwinian account of evolutionary adaptation. I
          argue that Dennett's empirical assumptions about the evolution of
          psychological phenotypes may well be unwarranted; and that, in any
          event, the intentionality of minds is quite different from and not
          reducible to the intensionality of selection.

      abstract:
        - Unless propositional content can be shown to supervene on internal
          physical states of agents, the semantics (e.g., I want sorbet and I
          believe there is some in the freezer) that sometimes accompany our
          brain states must be causally irrelevant to agent behavior (e.g., my
          entering the kitchen and opening the freezer door). In a valiant
          effort to salvage an explanatory role for content without giving up
          the nonsupervenience thesis, Fred Dretske (Explaining Behavior, 1988)
          invents a special kind of content-involving causal model. I critically
          examine this model and show that, despite its ingenuity, it is wildly
          implausible.

      abstract:
        - This article reviews the transition between post-Fregean
          anti-naturalistic epistemology and contemporary naturalistic
          epistemologies. It traces the revival of naturalism to Quine's
          critique of the "a priori", and Kuhn's defense of historicism, and use
          the arguments of Quine and Kuhn to identify a position, "traditional
          naturalism", that combines naturalistic themes with the claim that
          epistemology is a normative enterprise. Pleas for more radical
          versions of naturalism are articulated, and briefly confronted (phil.
          index).

      abstract:
        - v0.7.1 (June 2016) Added the ability to put "caps" on the error bars
          that are drawn by barplot or pointplot (and, by extension,
          factorplot). Additionally, the line width of the error bars can now be
          controlled. These changes involve the new parameters capsize and
          errwidth. See the github pull request for examples of usage. Improved
          the row and column colors display in clustermap. It is now possible to
          pass Pandas objects for these elements and, when possible, the
          semantic information in the Pandas objects will be used to add labels
          to the plot. When Pandas objects are used, the color data is matched
          against the main heatmap based on the index, not on position. This is
          more accurate, but it may lead to different results if current code
          assumed positional matching. Improved the luminance calculation that
          determines the annotation color in heatmap. The annot parameter of
          heatmap now accepts a rectangular dataset in addition to a boolean
          value. If a dataset is passed, its values will be used for the
          annotations, while the main dataset will be used for the heatmap cell
          colors. Fixed a bug in FacetGrid that appeared when using col_wrap
          with missing col levels. Made it possible to pass a tick locator
          object to the heatmap colorbar. Made it possible to use different
          styles (e.g., step) for PairGrid histograms when there are multiple
          hue levels. Fixed a bug in scipy-based univariate kernel density
          bandwidth calculation. The reset_orig function (and, by extension,
          importing seaborn.apionly) resets matplotlib rcParams to their values
          at the time seaborn itself was imported, which should work better with
          rcParams changed by the jupyter notebook backend. Removed some objects
          from the top-level seaborn namespace. Improved unicode compatibility
          in FacetGrid.

        - "Recent research carried out during organisation of the Cori Museum
          (Latina) has resulted in a significant revision and substantial
          updating of all our knowledge of the ancient city of Cora (Cori), in
          Latium. The study presented here is an updated and critical report on
          all the available sources and finds related to the history and the
          archaeology of the city and its territory, from its origins to
          medieval times. The analysis considers all these elements,
          specifically in the context of the history of Latium as a whole and
          its connections with Rome. With the help of unpublished or
          little-known information, the following elements are analysed in
          detail: the city's foundation myth; the important role of the archaic
          and high-republican city; the urban phases (focussing principally on
          the earliest organisation, dated to the archaic period, and on the 2nd
          century B.C. monumental building programme); the local pantheon and
          the principal sanctuaries; the monuments and the urban buildings; the
          organisation of the territory; the first evidence of the Christian
          cult."

      abstract:
        - "The advent of complete genetic linkage maps consisting of codominant
          DNA markers [typically restriction fragment length polymorphisms
          (RFLPs)] has stimulated interest in the systematic genetic dissection
          of discrete Mendelian factors underlying quantitative traits in
          experimental organisms. We describe here a set of analytical methods
          that modify and extend the classical theory for mapping such
          quantitative trait loci (QTLs). These include: (i) a method of
          identifying promising crosses for QTL mapping by exploiting a
          classical formula of SEWALL WRIGHT; (ii) a method (interval mapping)
          for exploiting the full power of RFLP linkage maps by adapting the
          approach of LOD score analysis used in human genetics, to obtain
          accurate estimates of the genetic location and phenotypic effect of
          QTLs; and (iii) a method (selective genotyping) that allows a
          substantial reduction in the number of progeny that need to be scored
          with the DNA markers. In addition to the exposition of the methods,
          explicit graphs are provided that allow experimental geneticists to
          estimate, in any particular case, the number of progeny required to
          map QTLs underlying a quantitative trait."

      abstract:
        - Beauty is an important part of our lives. Ugliness too. It is
          nosurprise then that philosophers since antiquity have been
          interestedin our experiences of and judgments about beauty and
          ugliness. Theyhave tried to understand the nature of these experiences
          andjudgments, and they have also wanted to know whether these
          experiencesand judgments were legitimate. Both these projects took a
          sharpenedform in the 20th century, when this part of our lives came
          under asustained attack in both European and American intellectual
          circles.Much of the discourse about beauty since the 18th century had
          deployeda notion of the “aesthetic”, and so that notion inparticular
          came in for criticism. This disdain for the aesthetic mayhave roots in
          a broader cultural Puritanism, which fears theconnection between the
          aesthetic and pleasure. Even to suggest, in therecent climate, that an
          artwork might be good because it ispleasurable, as opposed to
          cognitively, morally or politicallybeneficial, is to court derision.
          The 20th century has not been kindto the notions of beauty or the
          aesthetic. Nevertheless, some thinkers— philosophers, as well as
          others in the study of particulararts — have persisted in thinking
          seriously about beauty and theaesthetic. In the first part of this
          essay, we look at theparticularly rich account of judgments of beauty
          given to us byImmanuel Kant. The notion of a “judgment of taste”
          iscentral to Kant's account and also to virtually everyone working
          intraditional aesthetics; so we begin by examining
          Kant'scharacterization of the judgment of taste. In the second part,
          we lookat the issues that 20th century thinkers have raised. We end
          bydrawing on Kant's account of the judgment of taste to consider
          whetherthe notion of the aesthetic is viable.

      abstract:
        - It is a well-known but little-studied fact that evaluativeadverbs -
          adverbs indicating the attitude of the speaker towards theinformation
          she is conveying - can modify degree ('incredibly tall','ridiculously
          expensive'...). This thesis offers a syntactosemanticaccount of
          evaluative degree modi fication of both gradable adjectivesand
          gradable nouns.Following Morzycki (2004), I propose that evaluative
          degreemodi fication involves a covert operator (which I will call
          EVAL);however, my proposal differs from that of Morzycki in several
          crucialrespects. Most importantly, I argue that evaluative
          degreeconstructions should not be analysed as embedded
          exclamatives.Furthermore, I show how their syntactic behaviour
          illuminates theirsemantic composition, using evidence from different
          phenomena in bothEnglish and Dutch.Subsequently, I examine the
          linguistic evidence for the gradability ofcertain nouns, like 'idiot',
          'nerd', 'genius', 'Barbie dollenthusiast', and 'weirdo', and conclude
          that they, like gradableadjectives, have a degree argument. I show how
          this class of gradablenouns may be defined in prototype-theoretic
          terms. Morzycki (2009)has shown that gradable nouns can be modified by
          size adjectives like'big' and 'enormous'; I extend his account by
          including degreemodification by evaluative adjectives.Finally, several
          suggestions for further research are offered.

      abstract:
        - A counting Bloom filter (CBF) generalizes a Bloom filter data
          structure so as to allow membership queries on a set that can be
          changing dynamically via insertions and deletions. As with a Bloom
          filter, a CBF obtains space savings by allowing false positives. We
          provide a simple hashing-based alternative based on d-left hashing
          called a d-left CBF (dlCBF). The dlCBF offers the same functionality
          as a CBF, but uses less space, generally saving a factor of two or
          more. We describe the construction of dlCBFs, provide an analysis, and
          demonstrate their effectiveness experimentally.

      abstract:
        - The epitopes present on beta-(1–>4)-galactosyltransferase-1 (beta
          4Gal-T1) have been explored using a panel of monoclonal antibodies
          (mAbs) raised against the soluble form of the human enzyme. Reactivity
          of the antibodies with site-specific and truncated mutants of human
          beta 4Gal-T1 suggests the presence of a major immunogenic epitope
          cluster consisting of four epitopes within the stem region and mapping
          between amino acids 42 and 115. The catalytic activity of the enzyme
          is increased in the presence of stem region-specific antibody. Two of
          the epitopes were further localized to a region between amino acids 42
          and 77, sequences which are not shared with the recently cloned beta
          4Gal-T2 and beta 4Gal-T3 enzymes. An epitope located close to or
          within the catalytic domain is also identified, and the mAb to this
          region binds synergistically with antibodies to the stem region.

        - "Pleckstrin homology (PH) domains may act as membrane localization
          modules through specific interactions with phosphoinositide
          phospholipids. These interactions could represent responses to second
          messengers, with scope for regulation by soluble inositol
          polyphosphates. A biosensor-based assay was used here to probe
          interactions between PH domains and unilamellar liposomes containing
          different phospholipids and to demonstrate specificity for distinct
          phosphoinositides. The dynamin PH domain specifically interacted with
          liposomes containing phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate [PI(4,5)P2]
          and, more weakly, with liposomes containing
          phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate [PI(4)P]. This correlates with
          phosphoinositide activation of the dynamin GTPase. The functional
          GTPase of a dynamin mutant lacking the PH domain, however, cannot be
          activated by PI(4,5)P2. The phosphoinositide-PH domain interaction can
          be abolished selectively by point mutations in the putative binding
          pocket predicted by molecular modelling and NMR spectroscopy. In
          contrast, the Bruton's tyrosine kinase (Btk)PH domain specifically
          bound liposomes containing phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-trisphosphate
          [PI(3,4,5)P3]: an interaction requiring Arg28, a residue found to be
          mutated in some X-linked agammaglobulinaemia patients. A rational
          explanation for these different specificities is proposed through
          modelling of candidate binding pockets and is supported by NMR
          spectroscopy."

        - Organizations have significantly increased their use of contracting in
          information systems (IS), hiring contractors to work with permanent
          professionals. Based on theories of social exchange and social
          comparison, we hypothesize differences in work attitudes, behaviors,
          and performance across the two groups, and evaluate our hypotheses
          with a sequential mixed-methods design. Our first study surveys
          contract and permanent professionals on software development teams in
          a large transportation company. Our second study involves in-depth
          interviews with contract and permanent IS professionals in three
          organizations. We find support for many of our hypotheses but also
          some surprising results. Contrary to our predictions, contractors
          perceive a more favorable work environment than permanent
          professionals but exhibit lower in-role and extra-role behaviors than
          their permanent counterparts. Supervisors perceive their contract
          subordinates as lower-performing and less loyal, obedient, and
          trustworthy. In-depth interviews help to explain these findings. Job
          design emerges as an important factor influencing contractors' work
          attitudes, behaviors, and performance. Supervisors restrict the scope
          of contractors' jobs, limiting their job behaviors and performance. To
          compensate, permanent professionals are assigned considerably enlarged
          job scopes, leading to their lower perceptions of the work
          environment. We propose a theoretical model that embraces job design
          in explaining differences in work outcomes for contract versus
          permanent professionals on software development teams. The results
          from our study imply that organizations should carefully design and
          balance the jobs of their contractors and permanent employees to
          improve attitudes, behaviors, and workplace performance.

      abstract:
        - Organizations have significantly increased their use of contracting in
          information systems (IS), hiring contractors to work with permanent
          professionals. Based on theories of social exchange and social
          comparison, we hypothesize differences in work attitudes, behaviors,
          and performance across the two groups, and evaluate our hypotheses
          with a sequential mixed-methods design. Our first study surveys
          contract and permanent professionals on software development teams in
          a large transportation company. Our second study involves in-depth
          interviews with contract and permanent IS professionals in three
          organizations. We find support for many of our hypotheses but also
          some surprising results. Contrary to our predictions, contractors
          perceive a more favorable work environment than permanent
          professionals but exhibit lower in-role and extra-role behaviors than
          their permanent counterparts. Supervisors perceive their contract
          subordinates as lower-performing and less loyal, obedient, and
          trustworthy. In-depth interviews help to explain these findings. Job
          design emerges as an important factor influencing contractors' work
          attitudes, behaviors, and performance. Supervisors restrict the scope
          of contractors' jobs, limiting their job behaviors and performance. To
          compensate, permanent professionals are assigned considerably enlarged
          job scopes, leading to their lower perceptions of the work
          environment. We propose a theoretical model that embraces job design
          in explaining differences in work outcomes for contract versus
          permanent professionals on software development teams. The results
          from our study imply that organizations should carefully design and
          balance the jobs of their contractors and permanent employees to
          improve attitudes, behaviors, and workplace performance.

        - This paper examines cognitive beliefs and affect influencing one's
          intention to continue using (continuance) information systems (IS).
          Expectation-confirmation theory is adapted from the consumer behavior
          literature and integrated with theoretical and empirical findings from
          prior IS usage research to theorize a model of IS continuance. Five
          research hypotheses derived from this model are empirically validated
          using a field survey of online banking users. The results suggest that
          users' continuance intention is determined by their satisfaction with
          IS use and perceived usefulness of continued IS use. User
          satisfaction, in turn, is influenced by their confirmation of
          expectation from prior IS use and perceived usefulness.
          Post-acceptance perceived usefulness is influenced by users'
          confirmation level. This study draws attention to the substantive
          differences between acceptance and continuance behaviors, theorizes
          and validates one of the earliest theoretical models of IS
          continuance, integrates confirmation and user satisfaction constructs
          within our current understanding of IS use, conceptualizes and creates
          an initial scale for measuring IS continuance, and offers an initial
          explanation for the acceptance-discontinuance anomaly.

        - For nearly two decades, the user-satisfaction construct has occupied a
          central role in behavioral research in Information Systems (IS). In
          industry, the construct has often been used as a surrogate for IS
          effectiveness. Given its widespread use by both academics and
          practitioners, it is surprising that no comprehensive theoretical
          assessment of this construct has been performed. This paper provides
          such a review. It begins by examining conceptual and theoretical
          limitations of the construct's use as a measure of IS effectiveness.
          Attention is then focused on the evolution of the construct in the
          literature and the theoretical problems associated with its broader
          use. The fundamental similarity between user satisfaction and the
          social and cognitive psychologists' notion of an attitude is
          suggested. The next sections focus on a discussion of attitude
          structures and function. First, alternative theoretical views on
          attitude structure are presented. While one of these structures, the
          family of expectancy-value models, is reflected in current research on
          user satisfaction, the second, the family of cognitive approaches, is
          not. The two attitude structures are considered from the perspective
          of possible refinements to future work in IS. Next, an examination is
          made of the ways in which these structures have been integrated in
          terms of understanding the relationship of users' affective responses
          to other responses (i.e., behavior or cognition). This leads to a
          discussion of the function attitudes might serve for the user other
          than the evaluation of an information system or IS staff. Finally, the
          question of how behavior influences attitude is considered. The paper
          concludes with suggestions for future work.

        - Organizations deploy advanced communication media such as audio and
          videoconferencing to enhance and extend group communication
          interactions. However, established groups (i.e., groups with a history
          of working together) can view and use the same technology differently
          from groups without any past experiences of working together. This
          study examines the relative influences of media condition and group
          cohesion on social presence, task participation, and group consensus.
          Results from a controlled laboratory experiment with 45 triads of
          college students working on a decision-making task showed that media
          condition (audio conferencing vs. desktop video-conferencing) has
          significantly smaller influences on social presence and task
          participation than group cohesion in established groups. The study
          found that influence of group cohesion over social presence is
          additive, rather than substitutive, to that of media condition. The
          study also established that task participation played a more important
          role than social presence in determining the degree of consensus among
          group members in computer-mediated communication environments.

      abstract:
        - This history of the books of Reading Abbey covers the period from the
          abbey's foundation to its dissolution, and also charts the dispersal
          of the book collections up until c.1610. It provides valuable evidence
          for intellectual life and the use of books in a medieval monastery. By
          continuing the story beyond the Dissolution of the Monasteries, and
          charting the initial stages of the dispersal of the Abbey's books
          (many into the large institutional collections which are their homes
          today), Alan Coates makes a valuable contribution to our understanding
          of the fate of monastic books and book-collecting in the second half
          of the sixteenth century.

      abstract:
        - From breaking the law to breaking a promise, how do people lie and how
          can they be caught?In this revised edition, Paul Ekman, a renowned
          expert in emotions research and nonverbal communication, adds a new
          chapter to present his latest research on his groundbreaking inquiry
          into lying and the methods for uncovering lies. Ekman has figured out
          the most important behavioral clues to deceit; he has developed a
          one-hour self-instructional program that trains people to observe and
          understand "micro expressions"; and he has done research that
          identifies the facial expressions that show whether someone is likely
          to become violent―a self-instructional program to train recognition of
          these dangerous signals has also been developed.Telling Lies describes
          how lies vary in form and how they can differ from other types of
          misinformation that can reveal untruths. It discusses how a person’s
          body language, voice, and facial expressions can give away a lie but
          still fool professional lie hunters?even judges, police officers, drug
          enforcement agents, and Secret Service agents.

          Alzheimer's disease, but research advances over the past three decades
          could change this gloomy picture. Genetic studies demonstrate that the
          disease has multiple causes. Interdisciplinary approaches combining
          biochemistry, molecular and cell biology, and transgenic modeling have
          revealed some of its molecular mechanisms. Progress in chemistry,
          radiology, and systems biology is beginning to provide useful
          biomarkers, and the emergence of personalized medicine is poised to
          transform pharmaceutical development and clinical trials. However,
          investigative and drug development efforts should be diversified to
          fully address the multifactoriality of the disease.

        - Functional connectivity analysis of resting state blood oxygen
          level-dependent (BOLD) functional MRI is widely used for noninvasively
          studying brain functional networks. Recent findings have indicated,
          however, that even small (≤1 mm) amounts of head movement during
          scanning can disproportionately bias connectivity estimates, despite
          various preprocessing efforts. Further complications for interregional
          connectivity estimation from time domain signals include the
          unaccounted reduction in BOLD degrees of freedom related to
          sensitivity losses from high subject motion. To address these issues,
          we describe an integrated strategy for data acquisition, denoising,
          and connectivity estimation. This strategy builds on our previously
          published technique combining data acquisition with multiecho (ME)
          echo planar imaging and analysis with spatial independent component
          analysis (ICA), called ME-ICA, which distinguishes BOLD (neuronal) and
          non-BOLD (artifactual) components based on linear echo-time dependence
          of signals-a characteristic property of BOLD T*2 signal changes. Here
          we show for 32 control subjects that this method provides a physically
          principled and nearly operator-independent way of removing complex
          artifacts such as motion from resting state data. We then describe a
          robust estimator of functional connectivity based on interregional
          correlation of BOLD-independent component coefficients. This
          estimator, called independent components regression, considerably
          simplifies statistical inference for functional connectivity because
          degrees of freedom equals the number of independent coefficients.
          Compared with traditional connectivity estimation methods, the
          proposed strategy results in fourfold improvements in signal-to-noise
          ratio, functional connectivity analysis with improved specificity, and
          valid statistical inference with nominal control of type 1 error in
          contrasts of connectivity between groups with different levels of
          subject motion.

      abstract:
        - In a quantum computer, creating superpositions of quantum bits
          (qubits) in different states can lead to a speed-up over classical
          computers [1], but quantum mechanics also allows for the superposition
          of quantum circuits [2]. In fact, it has recently been theoretically
          predicted that superimposing quantum circuits, each with a different
          gate order, could provide quantum computers with an even further
          computational advantage [3-5]. Here, we experimentally demonstrate
          this enhancement by applying two quantum gates in a superposition of
          both possible orders to determine whether the two gates commute or
          anti-commute. We are able to make this determination with only a
          single use (or query) of each gate, while all quantum circuits with a
          fixed order of gates would require at least two uses of one of the
          gates [3]. Remarkably, when the problem is scaled to N gates, creating
          a superposition of quantum circuits is likely to provide an
          exponential advantage over classical algorithms, and a linear
          advantage over quantum algorithms with fixed gate order [4]. The new
          resource that we exploit in our experiment can be interpreted as a
          "superposition of causal orders". We demonstrate such a superposition
          could allow some quantum algorithms to be implemented with an
          efficiency that is unlikely to be achieved on a quantum computer with
          a fixed gate order.

      abstract:
        - "Blindfolded or disoriented people have the tendency to walk in
          circles rather than on a straight line even if they wanted to. Here,
          we use a minimalistic walking model to examine this phenomenon. The
          bipedal spring-loaded inverted pendulum exhibits asymptotically stable
          gaits with centre of mass (CoM) dynamics and ground reaction forces
          similar to human walking in the sagittal plane. We extend this model
          into three dimensions, and show that stable walking patterns persist
          if the leg is aligned with respect to the body (here: CoM velocity)
          instead of a world reference frame. Further, we demonstrate that
          asymmetric leg configurations, which are common in humans, will
          typically lead to walking in circles. The diameter of these circles
          depends strongly on parameter configuration, but is in line with
          empirical data from human walkers. Simulation results suggest that
          walking radius and especially direction of rotation are highly
          dependent on leg configuration and walking velocity, which explains
          inconsistent veering behaviour in repeated trials in human data.
          Finally, we discuss the relation between findings in the model and
          implications for human walking."

      abstract:
        - This translation of the important Russian text covers the theory and
          computational methods of modified Lagrangian functions (MLFs) - a new
          branch of mathematical programming used to solve optimization
          problems. Providing a thorough analysis for both traditional convex
          programming and monotone maps, the book shows the advantages of MLFs
          over classical Lagrangian functions in such practical applications as
          numerical algorithms, economic modeling, decomposition, and nonconvex
          local constrained optimization. For mathematicians involved in
          discrete math and optimization, and for graduate students taking
          courses in complex analysis and mathematical programming, Modified
          Lagrangians and Monotone Maps in Optimization serves as an
          indispensable professional reference and graduate-level text that goes
          beyond the classical Lagrange scheme, and offers diverse techniques
          for tackling this field. ix, 438 p. ; 24 cm. Mathematical

      abstract:
        - This paper is devoted to a new regularization method for solving the
          numerical analytic continuation of an analytic function f(z) = f(x +
          iy) on a strip domain Omega(+) = {z = x + iy is an element of C
          vertical bar x is an element of R, 0 < y < y(0)}, where the data is
          given approximately only on the line y = 0. This problem is severely
          ill-posed and has important practical applications. The theoretical
          optimal error bound for the problem is proved which is independent of
          the selected regularization methods. A modified Tikhonov
          regularization method with asymptotic order optimal error estimates is
          proposed. This method can be numerically implemented easily by the
          fast Fourier transform. Some numerical examples are provided and a
          comparison with a Fourier regularization method is given, which show
          the modified Tikhonov method works very well.

      abstract:
        - Since it appeared in 1971, John Rawls's "A Theory of Justice" has
          become a classic. The author has now revised the original edition to
          clear up a number of difficulties he and others have found in the
          original book. Rawls aims to express an essential part of the common
          core of the democratic tradition–justice as fairness–and to provide an
          alternative to utilitarianism, which had dominated the Anglo-Saxon
          tradition of political thought since the nineteenth century. Rawls
          substitutes the ideal of the social contract as a more satisfactory
          account of the basic rights and liberties of citizens as free and
          equal persons. "Each person," writes Rawls, "possesses an
          inviolability founded on justice that even the welfare of society as a
          whole cannot override." Advancing the ideas of Rousseau, Kant,
          Emerson, and Lincoln, Rawls's theory is as powerful today as it was
          when first published.

      abstract:
        - With its gripping plot and pungent dialogue, Uncle Tom's Cabin offers
          readers today a passionate portrait of a nation on the verge of
          disunion and a surprisingly subtle examination of the relationship
          between race and nationalism that has always been at the heart of the
          American experience. This Broadview edition is based upon the first
          American edition of the novel and reprints its original illustrations
          and preface. In addition, it reprints all of the prefaces that Stowe
          wrote for authorized European editions of Uncle Tom's Cabin, offers a
          wide array of appendices that clarify the novel's participation in
          antebellum debates about domesticity, colonization, abolitionism, and
          the law, and includes sections on dramatic adaptations of the novel.

    fields:
      abstract:
        - This paper considers asymptotically efficient instrumental variables
          estimation of nonlinear models in an i.i.d. environment. The class of
          models includes nonlinear simultaneous equations models and other
          models of interest. A problem in constructing efficient instrumental
          variables estimators for such models is that the optimal instruments
          involve a conditional expectation, calculation of which can require
          functional form assumptions for the conditional distribution of
          endogenous variables, as well as integration. Nonparametric methods
          provide a way of avoiding this difficulty. Here it is shown that
          nonparametric estimates of the optimal instruments can give
          asymptotically efficient instrumental variables estimators. Also, ways
          of choosing the nonparametric estimate in applications are discussed.
          Two types of nonparametric estimates of the optimal instruments are
          considered. Each involves nonparametric regression, one by nearest
          neighbor and the other by series approximation. The finite sample
          properties of the estimators are considered in a small sampling
          experiment involving an endogenous dummy variable model.

        - 《互联网金融监管法律规制研究》致力于探寻互联网金融监管的法治之路。从互联网金融监管的基础理论出发，提出互联网金融监管的重点在于构建系统性风险防控的法律制度。与此同时，针对互联网金融不同业态进行分类法学解析，特别是对虚拟货币、第三方支付、P2P网络贷款平台以及股权众筹的监管法律问题进行了较为具体的研究，并点明基于不同业态的互联网金融监管的法律规制路径。对互联网金融监管规制的重点领域，包括互联网金融犯罪、域外互联网金融监管法制和互联网金融消费者风险防范和权益保护等法律问题进行了深入探讨。进而，面向全新的科技革命，对互联网金融信息披露及其豁免制度、监管沙盒、穿透式监管等互联网金融监管法制的前沿领域进行探索，在互联网金融信息披露豁免的标准及制度设计、如何构建和实施互联网金融监管机制等方面提出了自己的主张，着力于寻求平衡市场自由与经济安全、包容科技金融经营与监管的新机制。

        - We point out a simple relation between the nuclear vertex constant
          (NVC) and the overall normalization of the astrophysical S factor.
          Using predicted values of the NVC for the virtual decay of 8B→7Be+p we
          find S17(0)≈17.6 eVb for 7Be(p,γ)8B reactions, consistent with the low
          values extrapolated from direct capture measurements by Filippone et
          al. and by Vaughn et al. New possibilities, using proton transfer
          reactions, to measure the astrophysical S factor indirectly are
          proposed.

      abstract:
        - Among the tools of structural biology, NMR spectroscopy is unique in
          that it not only derives a static three-dimensional structure, but
          also provides an atomic-level description of the local fluctuations
          and global dynamics around this static structure. A battery of NMR
          experiments is now available to probe the motions of proteins and
          nucleic acids over the whole biologically relevant timescale from
          picoseconds to hours. Here we focus on one of these methods,
          relaxation dispersion, which resolves dynamics on the micro- to
          millisecond timescale. Key biological processes that occur on this
          timescale include enzymatic catalysis, ligand binding, and local
          folding. In other words, relaxation-dispersion-resolved dynamics are
          often closely related to the function of the molecule and therefore
          highly interesting to the structural biochemist. With an astounding
          sensitivity of ∼0.5%, the method detects low-population excited states
          that are invisible to any other biophysical method. The kinetics of
          the exchange between the ground state and excited states are
          quantified in the form of the underlying exchange rate, while
          structural information about the invisible excited state is obtained
          in the form of its chemical shift. Lastly, the population of the
          excited state can be derived. This diversity in the information that
          can be obtained makes relaxation dispersion an excellent method to
          study the detailed mechanisms of conformational transitions and
          molecular interactions. Here we describe the two branches of
          relaxation dispersion, R2 and R1ρ, discussing their applicability,
          similarities, and differences, as well as recent developments in pulse
          sequence design and data processing.

      abstract:
        - The Boogie Verification Debugger (BVD) is a tool that lets users
          explore the potential program errors reported by a deductive program
          verifier. The user interface is like that of a dynamic debugger, but
          the debugging happens statically without executing the program. BVD
          integrates with the programverification engine Boogie. Just as Boogie
          supports multiple language front-ends, BVD can work with those
          front-ends through a plug-in architecture. BVD plugins have been
          implemented for two state-of-the-art verifiers, VCC and Dafny.

        - We study the energy used by a production-level regional climate and
          weather simulation code on a distributed memory system with hybrid
          CPU-GPU nodes. The code is optimised for both processor architectures,
          for which we investigate both time and energy to solution. Operational
          constraints for time to solution can be met with both processor types,
          although on different numbers of nodes. Energy to solution is a factor
          3 lower with GPUs, but strong scaling can be pushed to larger node
          counts with CPUs to minimize time to solution. Our data shows that an
          affine relationship exists between energy and nodehours consumed by
          the simulation. We use this property to devise a simple and practical
          methodology for optimising for energy efficiency that can be applied
          to other applications, which we demonstrate with the HPCG benchmark.
          We conclude with a discussion about the relationship to the
          commonly-used GF/Watt metric.

        - We study the energy used by a production-level regional climate and
          weather simulation code on a distributed memory system with hybrid
          CPU-GPU nodes. The code is optimised for both processor architectures,
          for which we investigate both time and energy to solution. Operational
          constraints for time to solution can be met with both processor types,
          although on different numbers of nodes. Energy to solution is a factor
          3 lower with GPUs, but strong scaling can be pushed to larger node
          counts with CPUs to minimize time to solution. Our data shows that an
          affine relationship exists between energy and nodehours consumed by
          the simulation. We use this property to devise a simple and practical
          methodology for optimising for energy efficiency that can be applied
          to other applications, which we demonstrate with the HPCG benchmark.
          We conclude with a discussion about the relationship to the
          commonly-used GF/Watt metric.

      abstract:
        - "Given climate change predictions of a warmer world, there is growing
          concern that insulation-led improvements in building fabric aimed at
          reducing carbon emissions will exacerbate overheating. If true, this
          would seriously affect building regulations all over the world which
          have moved towards increased insulation regimes. Despite extensive
          research, the literature has failed to resolve the controversy of
          insulation performance, primarily due to varied scope and limited
          comparability of results. We approach this problem through carefully
          constructed pairwise comparisons designed to isolate the effect of
          insulation on overheating. We encompass the complete range of relevant
          variables: latitude, climate, insulation, thermal mass, glazing ratio,
          shading, occupancy, infiltration, ventilation, orientation, and
          thermal comfort models - creating 576,000 building variants. Data
          mining techniques are implemented in a novel framework to analyse this
          large dataset. To provide confidence, the modelling was validated
          against data collected from well-insulated dwellings. Our results
          demonstrate that all parameters have a significant impact on
          overheating risk. Although insulation is seen to both decrease and
          increase overheating, depending on the influence of other parameters,
          parameter ranking shows that insulation only accounts for up to 5% of
          overall overheating response. Indeed, in cases that are not already
          overheating through poor design, there is a strong overall tendency
          for increased insulation to reduce overheating. These results suggest
          that, in cases with acceptable overheating levels (below 3.7%), the
          use of improved insulation levels as part of a national climate change
          mitigation policy is not only sensible, but also helps deliver better
          indoor thermal environments."

      abstract:
        - Because they are not proper spectral modes, leaky modes do not obey
          the usual power orthogonality relations for an ideal waveguide. Two
          methods for circumventing this problem are presented in this paper.
          One approach is to use the fact that weakly leaky modes are
          approximately power orthogonal within a restricted region of space to
          define a new set of slightly coupled modes. The other is to abandon
          power orthogonality in favor of a more general, mathematically exact
          orthogonality relation. The relative merits of these two approaches
          are discussed.

        - In this study, electrochromic properties of cuprous oxide
          nanoparticles, self-accumulated on the surface of a sol-gel silica
          thin film, have been investigated by using UV-visible
          spectrophotometry in a lithium-based electrolyte cell. The cuprous
          oxide nanoparticles showed a reversible electrochromic process with a
          thin film transmission reduction of about 50% in a narrow wavelength
          range of 400-500Ânm, as compared to the bleached state of the film.
          Using optical transmission measurement, we have found that the band
          gap energy of the films reduced from 2.7ÂeV for Cu2O to 1.3ÂeV for CuO
          by increasing the annealing temperature from 220 to 300Â°C in an N2
          environment for 1Âh. Study of the band gaps of the as-deposited,
          colored and bleached states of the nanoparticles showed that the
          electrochromic process corresponded to a reversible red-ox conversion
          of Cu2O to CuO on the film surface, in addition to the reversible
          red-ox reaction of the Cu2O film. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy
          indicated that the copper oxide nanoparticles accumulated on the film
          surface, after annealing the samples at 200Â°C. Surface morphology of
          the films and particle size of the surface copper oxides have also
          been studied by atomic force microscopy analysis. The copper oxide
          nanoparticles with average size of about 100Ânm increased the surface
          area ratio and surface roughness of the silica films from 2.2% and
          0.8Ânm to 51% and 21Ânm, respectively.

      abstract:
        - Cluster model calculations have been carried out to study the
          electronic state and the chemical bonding in Cu2O and CuO as well as
          YBa2Cu3O7 and YBa2Cu3O6. The clusters used are Cu4O14-9, Cu4O16-12,
          Cu3O17-12 and Cu3O15-10, respectively, each being embedded in an
          appropriate electrostatic potential reflecting the crystal structure.
          The covalent interaction between Cu and O is most significant in the
          cluster for the high-temperature superconductor YBa2CuO7. It is
          remarkable that O 2p[pi] holes are created near the Fermi level and
          stabilized in the O—-Cu+—O- linear bond formed in the basal Cu2O plane
          of the cluster for YBa2Cu3O7. A charge disproportionation takes place
          both in the model clusters for YBa2Cu3O7 and YBa2Cu3O6, while a spin
          polarization is seen only in the latter. The similarity and
          dissimilarity of Cu atoms in those oxides are discussed.

          Original annotation: 


          *16th edition only.* A Review entry presenting a review from a scholarly journaltitle, hence no entrysubtype needed.  Note the bibstrings in the title of the review, and the formatting of the title of the book reviewed there.  Also note the use of \\parteditandtrans.  The author-date system doesn't absolutely require the use of these mechanisms, which were invented to cope with the differences between notes and bibliography in the other Chicago style.  Still, although simply writing "edited and translated by" yourself will suffice, using these mechanisms will make your .bib file work across multiple languages, and will also allow it to work, with fewer modifications, in the notes \\&amp; bibliography style, should that be needed.  See next entry.

          biblatex-chicago example, adapted from

          Original annotation: 


          *16th edition only.* A Review entry presenting a review from a scholarly journaltitle, hence no entrysubtype needed.  Note the bibstrings in the title of the review, and the formatting of the title of the book reviewed there.  Also note the use of \\parteditandtrans.  The author-date system doesn't absolutely require the use of these mechanisms, which were invented to cope with the differences between notes and bibliography in the other Chicago style.  Still, although simply writing "edited and translated by" yourself will suffice, using these mechanisms will make your .bib file work across multiple languages, and will also allow it to work, with fewer modifications, in the notes \\&amp; bibliography style, should that be needed.  See next entry.

        - The first step in any quantum key distribution (QKD) protocol consists
          of sequences of measurements that produce correlated classical data.
          We show that these correlation data must violate some Bell inequality
          in order to contain distillable secrecy, if not they could be produced
          by quantum measurements performed on a separable state of larger
          dimension. We introduce a new QKD protocol and prove its security
          against any individual attack by an adversary only limited by the
          no-signaling condition.

          plans are to be executed, stored, and reused. The key to all of these
          techniques are the <i>triangle tables</i>, which are a limited form of
          explanation-based learning. They also underly the approach to
          execution monitoring. For the plan monitoring, the triangle table
          contains a cached out representation of the preconditions necessary
          for execution of each plan suffix. So the executor monitors the truth
          of each of these preconditions, allowing it both to re-execute failed
          prefixes and exploit opportunities to skip steps.

        - A more in-depth version of Drew's AIPS-96 paper, that described his
          search heuristic for forward planners. The article discusses the
          problem of “attention-deficit” in McDermott's UNPOP — the problem of
          switching between goals too much. Also discusses preservation goals,
          which we have just been kludging into SA-CIRCA.

      abstract:
        - SHOP (Simple Hierarchical Ordered Planner) is a domain-independent HTN
          Planning system with the following characteristics. * SHOP plans for
          tasks in the same order that they will later be executed. This avoids
          some of the goal-interaction issues that arise in other HTN planners,
          thus making the planning algorithm relatively simple. * The planning
          algorithm is sound and complete over a large class of problems. *
          Since SHOP knows the complete world-state at each step of the planning
          process, it can use highly expressive domain representations. For
          example, it can do planning problems that require complex numeric
          computations. * In our tests, SHOP solved problems several orders of
          magnitude faster than Blackbox and TLplan. This occured even though
          SHOP is written in Lisp and the other planners are written in C. (Also
          cross-referenced as UMIACS-TR 99-04)

        - The SHOP2 planning system received one of the awards for distinguished
          performance in the 2002 International Planning Competition. This paper
          describes the features of SHOP2 which enabled it to excel in the
          competition, especially those aspects of SHOP2 that deal with temporal
          and metric planning domains.

        - "Cohen and Levesque critique KQML on three semantic grounds: ambiguity
          of specifications; misidentified performatives and performatives
          missing. The misidentified performatives are those that operate on
          other performatives where Cohen and Levesque argue that they should be
          operating directly on content. The major missing performative they
          identify is a commissive — the agreement to perform an action. They
          then propose that their logic of intention could be used to give a
          superior semantics. They conclude with some weak suggestions about the
          implications of this. Unfortunately, their semantics seem to be too
          “first principles-y” to be of much use to implementors. Finally, they
          say that extensibility and content independence are problems. It is
          hard to see how this is to be remedied."

          planning and deliberation scheduling methods for robot motion
          planning, based on Markov Decision Processes (MDPs). The method is

        - Similar to Drummond and Bresina paper Drummond:90, indeed an attempt
          to put it on more secure theoretical footing. Project is trying to
          find a path through a state-space automaton. Deliberation scheduling
          in this framework is the allocation of resources between <i>policy
          generation</i> for a subgraph of the overall automaton and <i>envelope
          expansion</i> to consider a larger subset of the state space. Compares
          <i>precursor-deliberation</i>, where you develop the whole policy
          before any execution, and <i>recurrent-deliberation</i>, where the
          agent repeatedly replans.

        - Etzioni et. al. provide a notion of dynamic closed-world reasoning.
          They do this by having, in addition to a database recording world
          state propositions, a local closed world (LCW) database, that records
          propositions about whose value they have complete knowledge. They
          present methods for updating LCW knowledge in response to the
          execution of actions and show that these update methods are sound and
          tractable, although not complete.

        - Describes a general constraint-based approach to modal logic
          deduction. Essentially the approach is to perform a Moore-like
          translation of the modal logic statements into a first order
          representation with explicit representation of the accessibility
          relations and existence of entities (for modal logics with different
          domains in different possible worlds). This representation is then
          partititioned into a set of statements and an associated set of
          constraints on relationships between possible worlds. When variables
          are unified, the associated world constraints must be verified.

        - Provides a representation of knowledge-producing actions in the
          situation calculus. Extends Reiter's explanation-closure solution to
          the frame problem to this extended situation calculus (in which
          successor state axioms are automatically generated from General
          Positive Effect and General Negative Effect axioms). The authors show
          that knowledge-producing actions can be handled using Reiter's
          explanation-closure approach. Further, they extend Reiter's regression
          operators to knowledge-producing actions. This permits one to check
          properties of a plan (e.g., does it achieve a particular goal
          proposition) by regressing those properties to the initial situation
          and then doing theorem-proving exclusively in that initial situation.

        - This paper describes the Cassandra approach to Michie's “keys and
          boxes”problem, which is similar to Moore's “bomb in the toilet”
          problem, in requiring both information-gathering actions and also
          action with only partial information (“fail-safe” planning).

        - The authors review Chapman's Modal Truth Criterion (MTC) from his
          paper “Planning for Conjunctive Goals.” They show a bug in Chapman's
          arguments — in particular that the equivalence ◇p ≡¬□¬p doesn't hold
          for truth in partially-ordered plans. The reason for this is that the
          excluded middle does not hold in the logic of partial plans — the
          truth value of some p in some completion of a partial plan may not be
          defined, because the completion may be ill-formed.

      abstract:
        - Hierarchical task network and action-based planning approaches have
          traditionally been studied separately. In many domains, human
          expertise in the form of hierarchical reduction schemas exists, but is
          incomplete. In such domains, hybrid approaches that use both HTN and
          action-based planning techniques are needed. In this paper, we extend
          our previous work on refinement planning to include hierarchical
          planning. Specifically, we provide a generalized plan-space refinement
          that is capable of handling non-primitive actions. The generalization
          provides a principled way of handling partially hierarchical domains,
          while preserving systematicity, and respecting the user-intent
          inherent in the reduction schemas. Our general account also puts into
          perspective the many surface differences between the HTN and
          action-based planners, and could support the transfer of progress
          between HTN and action-based planning approaches.

        - Fits HTN planning into Rao's unifying framework. Also shows how to do
          this in partially hierarchical domains, i.e., those where some goals
          do not have methods and use normal precondition-chaining. This doesn't
          really arise in our playbook applications, but it's very neat. Hard to
          tell how well this works out, since there are a whole bunch of fairly
          complex bits necessary to ensure completeness and systematicity. The
          latter could, of course, be sacrificed. Seems to subsume the
          hierarchical planning in DPOCL and Barrent and Weld, which is handy!
          It's always nice to be able to not read a paper!

          Levesque's work on knowledge-producing actions and Reiter and Lin's
          work on the frame problem, to agent programming. The central
          limitation of the work is that they have little to say about the
          generation of new plans/programs for agent actions — they center their
          discussion around the use of the logic for verification of agent
          programs.

        - As the name suggests, presents a sound and complete algorithm for HTN
          planning. The accomplishment is less overwhelming than it might at
          first seem, because the HTN plan's semantics rests on STRIPS-style
          world updates. So an HTN planner constructed according to this method
          will have the same knowledge-engineering demands as a first-principles
          STRIPS planner.

        - Erol, et. al. discuss the complexity and expressivity of HTN planning
          based on their UMCP planning. They show that HTN planning is strictly
          more expressive than simple STRIPS planning. The reason HTN planning
          is more expressive is that having a goal task network instead of a
          propositional goal allows the user of the system to specify not just
          what is to be achieved, but some aspects of how it is to be achieved.
          They use the example that in an HTN planner one can specify the goal
          of “build a house,” as distinct from simply “own a house,” which could
          also be satisfied by “buy a house.” As far as expressivity is
          concerned, HTN planning in the general case is undecidable. Forcing
          HTNs to be totally-ordered sets of tasks or removing variables from
          the tasks can reduce the complexity.

        - Planning is a central activity in many areas including robotics,
          manufacturing, space mission sequencing, and logistics. As the size
          and complexity of planning problems grow, there is great economic
          pressure to automate this process in order to reduce the cost of
          planning effort, and to improve the quality of produced plans. AI
          planning research has focused on general-purpose planning systems
          which can process the specifications of an application domain and
          generate solutions to planning problems in that domain. Unfortunately,
          there is a big gap between theoretical and application oriented work
          in AI planning. The theoretical work has been mostly based on
          state-based planning, which has limited practical applications. The
          application-oriented work has been based on hierarchical task network
          (HTN) planning, which lacks a theoretical foundation. As a result, in
          spite of many years of research, building planning applications
          remains a formidable task. The goal of this dissertation is to
          facilitate building reliable and effective planning applications. The
          methodology includes design of a mathematical framework for HTN
          planning, analysis of this framework, development of provably correct
          algorithms based on this analysis, and the implementation of these
          algorithms for further evaluation and exploration. The representation,
          analyses, and algorithms described in this thesis will make it easier
          to apply HTN planning techniques effectively and correctly to planning
          applications. The precise and mathematical nature of the descriptions
          will also help teaching about HTN planning, will clarify
          misconceptions in the literature, and will stimulate further research.

        - Baker discusses ways in which dynamic backtracking can behave
          exponentially worse than simpler approaches, in particular depth-first
          search and backjumping. Briefly, the intuition is that in the attempt
          to preserve work done through backtracking, dynamic backtracking often
          preserves constraints propagated from value choices that have since
          been retracted, confining it in bad parts of the search space.

        - LDS is a search technique that iteratively makes n decisions
          differently from the dictates of its heuristic, for increasing n. The
          intuition behind LDS is that heuristics often give recommendations
          that are worse at the start of the search than at the end.
          Accordingly, LDS makes divergent decisions initially at the beginning
          of the search path, working towards the end. Note that were this
          assumption wrong, depth-first search would work well, because it
          undoes decisions first at the end of the search. Harvey and Ginsberg
          also discuss combining LDS with bounded-backtrack search, which they
          show gives better behavior in large search spaces.

        - "In this paper, we investigate the links between planning and plans
          execution. We propose a new approach (Propice-Plan) which integrates
          both activities. It implements supervision and execution capabilities,
          combined with different planning techniques: – plan synthesis to
          complement existing operational plans; and – anticipation planning to
          advise the execution for the best option to take when facing choices
          (by anticipating plans execution), and to forecast problems that may
          arise due to unforeseen situations."

        - "Gives a summary of three-layer architectures for mobile robots. Gat's
          division into three layers is based on memory and algorithm run-time
          in the three layers: deliberation layer (top) allows algorithms with
          long latencies: several Behavior transitions can occur before one of
          these terminates. The middle layer is the sequencer, whose job it is
          to select primitive Behaviors, and supply parameters. The Sequencer is
          allowed to use algorithms with memory. At the bottom level is the
          Controller, which contains Behaviors, which should run one iteration
          in constant-bounded time and space, ideally being continuous in the
          input, and not using memory (although Gat makes exception for
          filters). Gat also argues that behaviors should fail cognizantly. This
          is interesting, because not what I would have expected because I'm
          either (a) a planning bigot or (b) realistic about the fact that one
          typically doesn't own an entire execution platform, depending on
          whether you're being (a) harsh or (b) kind. I tend to think that you
          are given the Controller (or at least a subset thereof), and that
          cognizant failure may be more than you can ask. Also the Sequencer is
          needed to provide a plan-cognizant layer above the Controller, which
          typically doesn't know anything about the context of its behaviors."

      abstract:
        - Agents situated in dynamic and uncertain environments require several
          capabilities for successful operation. Such agents must monitor the
          world and respond appropriately to important events. The agents should
          be able to accept goals, synthesize complex plans for achieving those
          goals, and execute the plans while continuing to be responsive to
          changes in the world. As events render some current activities
          obsolete, the agents should be able to modify their plans while
          continuing activities unaffected by those events. The CYPRESS system
          is a domain-independent framework for defining persistent agents with
          this full range of behavior. CYPRESS has been used for several
          demanding applications, including military operations, real-time
          tracking, and fault diagnosis.

        - This paper concerns a way to assign probabilities of reaching states
          to CIRCA plans. It makes a number of seemingly arbitrary simplifying
          assumptions and seems to me to be fundamentally goofy. I have written
          email to the first author to raise a number of questions about the
          work.

          monitor other team members to verify that the team are working
          together succesfully. The method is particularly of use in cases where
          agent-to-communications are not reliable. An extra bonus of the
          article is that it provides a useful hook into the literature on team
          action and shared plans.

        - Contains a description of an agent synthesis algorithm involving
          verification and discusses incremental verification. Unlike the CIRCA
          method, hers is based on characterizing which changes to the agent
          would invalidate earlier verification results.

        - Describes a technique for adding automatic repair to model checking
          verification. They use abductive model revision to alter a concurrent
          program description in the face of a counterexample. Their concurrent
          programs are described in terms of jumps and (boolean) assignments.
          Repairs are in terms of changing assignment values and changing
          assignment orderings. The class of repairs considered here seem most
          appropriate for handling concurrency protocol errors, especially
          involving mutual exclusion and deadlocks. They seem less appropriate
          for control applications. Counterexamples are used to reduce the set
          of repair candidates that must be considered. (In order to handle ACTL
          formulas, the authors consider tree-shaped counterexamples, not just
          simple linear counterexamples.) In particular, their technique
          “identifies corrections α under which the counterexample is invariant,
          i.e., still apply if α is implemented.” They introduce efficiently
          computable conditions on counterexamples and corrections that provide
          this filtering.

        - A somewhat disappointing paper. The most difficult problem (credit
          where credit is due, this was identified by the authors) in having
          SHOP control other agents, is that in evaluating preconditions, SHOP
          must be able to project the effects of the actions of other agents.
          However, this very interesting engineering problem is just made the
          responsibility of the “monitoring agent” and left as an exercise for
          the reader.

        - This document defines the language to be used in the classical part of
          the 4th International Planning Competition, IPC-4. The language
          comprises all of PDDL2.1 levels 1, 2, and 3, as defined by Maria Fox
          and Derek Long in fox:long:jair-03; parts of this document have been
          copied from that source. On top of this language, for IPC-4 <i>derived
          predicates</i> are re-introduced, and <i>timed initial literals</i>
          are (newly) introduced into the competition language. We give the
          syntax and semantics of these constructs.

        - Contains a description of the typed, object-oriented, language for HTN
          planners. The work is interesting and offers checking to make sure
          that transitions are well-founded, in terms of the objects that make
          up the domain. Somewhat limited, however, in terms of the richness of
          the object hierarchy, and the sorts of things that an HTN method is
          allowed to do. There's a discussion of how OCLₕ could be used to
          formalize O-Plan operators.

        - We explore the situation calculus within the framework of inductive
          definability. A consequence of this view of the situation calculus is
          to establish direct connections with different variants of the
          mu-calculus, structural operational semantics of concurrent processes,
          and logic programming. First we show that the induction principle on
          situations is implied by an inductive definition of the set of
          situations. Then we consider the frame problem from the point of view
          of inductive definability and by defining fluents inductively we
          obtain essentially the same form of successor state axioms as
          Reiter's. Our approach allows extending this result to the case where
          ramification constraints are present. Finally we demonstrate a method
          of applying inductive definitions for computing fixed point properties
          of GOLOG programs.

      abstract:
        - Hierarchical Task Network (HTN) planning (Sacerdoti 1974) is an
          approach to planning where problem-specific knowledge is used to
          remedy the computational intractability of classical planning. This
          knowledge is in the form of task decomposition directives, i.e. the
          planner is given a set of methods that tell it how a high-level task
          can be decomposed into lower-level tasks. The HTN planning problem
          consists in computing a sequence of primitive tasks that corresponds
          to performing the initial set of high-level tasks. Our purpose in this
          prthis paper is 1) to give an account of HTNplanning as high-level
          programming in the situation calculus (McCarthy 1963) based languages
          Golog/ConGolog (Levesque et al. 1997; De Giacomo, Lesperance, &
          Levesque 2000) and 2) to illustrate our approach with a ConGolog
          encoding of a logistics domain HTN-planning problem. The
          Golog/ConGolog languages have been extended to deal with explicit
          time, sensing actions, exogenous events, execution monitoring,
          incomplete knowledge of the initial state, stochastic actions and
          others. Thus the range of problems that can be tackled with this
          approach is potentially much larger. As an example, we modified the
          logistics domain encoding to execute on-line and deal with run-time
          exogenous delivery requests

        - "Abstract: Closed-world inference-an essential component of many
          planning algorithms-is the process of determining that a logical
          sentence is false based on its absence from a knowledge base, or the
          inability to derive it. We describe a novel method for closed-world
          inference and update over the first-order theories of action used by
          planning algorithms such as NONLIN, TWEAK, and UCPOP. We show the
          method to be sound and efficient, but incomplete. In our experiments,
          closed-world inference consistently averaged about 2 milliseconds
          while updates averaged approximately 1.2 milliseconds. Furthermore, we
          demonstrate that incompleteness is nonproblematic in practice, since
          our mechanism makes over 99% of the desired inferences. We
          incorporated our method into the XII planner, which supports our
          Internet Softbot (software robot). The technique cut the number of
          actions executed by the Softbot by a factor of one hundred, and
          resulted in a corresponding speedup to XII."

      abstract:
        - "Description Logics are a family of knowledge representation languages
          that have been studied extensively in Artificial Intelligence over the
          last two decades. They are embodied in several knowledge-based systems
          and are used to develop various real-life applications. The
          Description Logic Handbook provides a thorough account of the subject,
          covering all aspects of research in this field, namely: theory,
          implementation, and applications. Its appeal will be broad, ranging
          from more theoretically-oriented readers, to those with more
          practically-oriented interests who need a sound and modern
          understanding of knowledge representation systems based on Description
          Logics. The chapters are written by some of the most prominent
          researchers in the field, introducing the basic technical material
          before taking the reader to the current state of the subject, and
          including comprehensive guides to the literature. In sum, the book
          will serve as a unique reference for the subject, and can also be used
          for self-study or in conjunction with Knowledge Representation and
          Artificial Intelligence courses."

      abstract:
        - Applications that require alternative plans challenge the single
          solution, single quality metric assumptions upon which many classical
          planners are designed and evaluated. To evaluate the distinctness of
          alternative plans (i.e., plan sets), researchers have created
          diversity metrics that often measure the set difference between the
          actions of plans. Many approaches for generating plan sets embed the
          same diversity metric in a weighted evaluation function to guide the
          search mechanism, thus confounding the search process with its
          evaluation. We discover that two diversity metrics fail to distinguish
          similar plans from each other or to identify plans with extraneous
          actions, so we introduce two new diversity metrics, <i>uniqueness</i>
          and <i>overlap</i>, to capture these cases. We then examine the
          tradeoffs of producing diverse plans while we control for plan length
          and metric interaction and confirm that metric interaction can
          significantly impact search performance. We show that planners
          searching for plan sets must consider a third metric,
          <i>parsimony</i>, that prefers shorter plans while maximizing
          diversity.We evaluate three existing approaches for generating diverse
          plans and two new algorithms that are designed to explicitly manage
          diversity and interaction between the diversity and quality metrics.
          Our findings synthesize and extend recent results in plan diversity.

      abstract:
        - "Abstract Planning is motivated by acting. Most of the existing work
          on automated planning underestimates the reasoning and deliberation
          needed for acting; it is instead biased towards path-finding methods
          in a compactly specified state-transition system. Researchers in this
          {AI} field have developed many planners, but very few actors. We
          believe this is one of the main causes of the relatively low
          deployment of automated planning applications. In this paper, we
          advocate a change in focus to actors as the primary topic of
          investigation. Actors are not mere plan executors: they may use
          planning and other deliberation tools, before and during acting. This
          change in focus entails two interconnected principles: a hierarchical
          structure to integrate the actorʼs deliberation functions, and
          continual online planning and reasoning throughout the acting process.
          In the paper, we discuss open problems and research directions toward
          that objective in knowledge representations, model acquisition and
          verification, synthesis and refinement, monitoring, goal reasoning,
          and integration."

        - Shortcomings of qualitative simulation and of quantitative simulation
          motivate combining them to do simulations exhibiting strengths of
          both. The resulting class of techniques is called semiquantitative
          simulation. One approach to semi-quantitative simulation is to use
          numeric intervals to represent incomplete quantitative information. In
          this research we demonstrate semi-quantitative simulation using
          intervals in an implemented semi-quantitative simulator called Q3. Q3
          progressively refines a qualitative simulation, providing increasingly
          specific quantitative predictions which can converge to a numerical
          simulation in the limit while retaining important correctness
          guarantees from qualitative and interval simulation techniques. Q3's
          simulations are based on a technique we call step size refinement.
          While a pure qualitative simulation has a very coarse step size,
          representing the state of a system trajectory at relatively few
          qualitatively distinct states, Q3 interpolates newly explicit states
          between distinct qualitative states, thereby representing more states
          which instantiate new constraints, leading to improved quantitative
          inferences. Q3's techniques have been used for prediction, measurement
          interpretation, diagnosis, and even analysis of the probabilities of
          qualitative behaviors. Because Q3 shares important expressive and
          inferential properties of both qualitative and quantitative
          simulation, Q3 helps to bridge the gap between qualitative and
          quantitative simulation.

        - The Anthropology of Islam Reader brings together a rich variety of
          ethnographic work, offering an insight into various forms of Islam as
          practiced in different geographic, social, and cultural contexts.
          Topics explored include Ramadan and the Hajj, the Feast of Sacrifice,
          and the representation of Islam. An extensive introduction and
          bibliography helps students develop their understanding of the variety
          of methodological and theoretical approaches involved in the
          anthropological study of Islam. In his selections, Jens Kreinath
          highlights the diversity of practices and themes that were formative
          for this field of study, making this essential reading for students of
          Islam at undergraduate and graduate level.

        - In 2011 the international development community committed to make
          development co-operation more effective to deliver better results for
          the world&#8217;s poor. At the mid-point between commitments endorsed
          in the High-Level Forum in Busan, Korea in 2011 and the 2015 target
          date of the Millennium Development Goals,&nbsp; this report takes
          stock of how far we have come and where urgent challenges lie. This
          report - a first snapshot of the state-of-play since Busan - reveals
          both successes and shortfalls. It draws on the ten indicators of the
          Global Partnership monitoring framework. Despite global economic
          turbulence, changing political landscapes and domestic budgetary
          pressure, commitment to effective development co-operation principles
          remains strong. Longstanding efforts to change the way that
          development co-operation is delivered are paying off. Past
          achievements on important aid effectiveness commitments that date back
          to 2005 have been sustained. Nevertheless, much more needs to be done
          to translate political commitments into concrete action. This report
          highlights where targeted efforts are needed to make further progress
          and to reach existing targets for more effective development
          co-operation by 2015.

          389 The phrase, the 'temple of God', which occurs eleven times in the
          NT(24), connotes a spiritual application in in every instance except
          one. The only occasion in which the phrase refers to the physical
          temple in Jerusalem is in Matt 26,61. However, the use of this phrase
          in Matthew, instead of weakening the case for a spiritual
          understanding throughout the NT, strengthens it." 


          p389 NT Refs 


          Matt 26:61; 1 Cor 3:16-17; 2 Cor 6:16; 2 Thess 2:4; Rev 3:12; 7:15;11:1-19; 


          Eph 2:19-22; 1 Pet 2:5 


          Matthew 26:61 61 and said, ‘This fellow said, “I am able to destroy the temple of God and to build it in three days.”’ 1 Corinthians 3:16-17 16 Do you not know that you are God’s temple and that God’s Spirit dwells in you?[a] 17 If anyone destroys God’s temple, God will destroy that person. For God’s temple is holy, and you are that temple. 2 Corinthians 6:16 16 What agreement has the temple of God with idols? For we[a] are the temple of the living God; as God said, ‘I will live in them and walk among them,
               and I will be their God,
               and they shall be my people. 2 Thessalonians 2:4 4 He opposes and exalts himself above every so-called god or object of worship, so that he takes his seat in the temple of God, declaring himself to be God. Revelation 3:12 12 If you conquer, I will make you a pillar in the temple of my God; you will never go out of it. I will write on you the name of my God, and the name of the city of my God, the new Jerusalem that comes down from my God out of heaven, and my own new name. Revelation 7:15 
           15 For this reason they are before the throne of God,
               and worship him day and night within his temple,
               and the one who is seated on the throne will shelter them. Revelation 11 The Two Witnesses
           11 Then I was given a measuring rod like a staff, and I was told, ‘Come and measure the temple of God and the altar and those who worship there, 2 but do not measure the court outside the temple; leave that out, for it is given over to the nations, and they will trample over the holy city for forty-two months. 3 And I will grant my two witnesses authority to prophesy for one thousand two hundred and sixty days, wearing sackcloth.’ 4 These are the two olive trees and the two lampstands that stand before the Lord of the earth. 5 And if anyone wants to harm them, fire pours from their mouth and consumes their foes; anyone who wants to harm them must be killed in this manner. 6 They have authority to shut the sky, so that no rain may fall during the days of their prophesying, and they have authority over the waters to turn them into blood, and to strike the earth with every kind of plague, as often as they desire. 7 When they have finished their testimony, the beast that comes up from the bottomless pit will make war on them and conquer them and kill them, 8 and their dead bodies will lie in the street of the great city that is prophetically[a] called Sodom and Egypt, where also their Lord was crucified. 9 For three and a half days members of the peoples and tribes and languages and nations will gaze at their dead bodies and refuse to let them be placed in a tomb; 10 and the inhabitants of the earth will gloat over them and celebrate and exchange presents, because these two prophets had been a torment to the inhabitants of the earth. 11 But after the three and a half days, the breath[b] of life from God entered them, and they stood on their feet, and those who saw them were terrified. 12 Then they[c] heard a loud voice from heaven saying to them, ‘Come up here!’ And they went up to heaven in a cloud while their enemies watched them. 13 At that moment there was a great earthquake, and a tenth of the city fell; seven thousand people were killed in the earthquake, and the rest were terrified and gave glory to the God of heaven. 14 The second woe has passed. The third woe is coming very soon. The Seventh Trumpet
           15 Then the seventh angel blew his trumpet, and there were loud voices in heaven, saying, ‘The kingdom of the world has become the kingdom of our Lord
               and of his Messiah,[d]
           and he will reign for ever and ever.’
           16 Then the twenty-four elders who sit on their thrones before God fell on their faces and worshipped God, 17 singing, ‘We give you thanks, Lord God Almighty,
               who are and who were,
           for you have taken your great power
               and begun to reign.
           18 The nations raged,
               but your wrath has come,
               and the time for judging the dead,
           for rewarding your servants,[e] the prophets
               and saints and all who fear your name,
               both small and great,
           and for destroying those who destroy the earth.’
           19 Then God’s temple in heaven was opened, and the ark of his covenant was seen within his temple; and there were flashes of lightning, rumblings, peals of thunder, an earthquake, and heavy hail. ### miscs Ephesians 2:19-22 19 So then you are no longer strangers and aliens, but you are citizens with the saints and also members of the household of God, 20 built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets, with Christ Jesus himself as the cornerstone.[a] 21 In him the whole structure is joined together and grows into a holy temple in the Lord; 22 in whom you also are built together spiritually[b] into a dwelling-place for God. 1 Peter 2:5 5 like living stones, let yourselves be built[a] into a spiritual house, to be a holy priesthood, to offer spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God through Jesus Christ.

           11 Then I was given a measuring rod like a staff, and I was told, ‘Come and measure the temple of God and the altar and those who worship there, 2 but do not measure the court outside the temple; leave that out, for it is given over to the nations, and they will trample over the holy city for forty-two months. 3 And I will grant my two witnesses authority to prophesy for one thousand two hundred and sixty days, wearing sackcloth.’ 4 These are the two olive trees and the two lampstands that stand before the Lord of the earth. 5 And if anyone wants to harm them, fire pours from their mouth and consumes their foes; anyone who wants to harm them must be killed in this manner. 6 They have authority to shut the sky, so that no rain may fall during the days of their prophesying, and they have authority over the waters to turn them into blood, and to strike the earth with every kind of plague, as often as they desire. 7 When they have finished their testimony, the beast that comes up from the bottomless pit will make war on them and conquer them and kill them, 8 and their dead bodies will lie in the street of the great city that is prophetically[a] called Sodom and Egypt, where also their Lord was crucified. 9 For three and a half days members of the peoples and tribes and languages and nations will gaze at their dead bodies and refuse to let them be placed in a tomb; 10 and the inhabitants of the earth will gloat over them and celebrate and exchange presents, because these two prophets had been a torment to the inhabitants of the earth. 11 But after the three and a half days, the breath[b] of life from God entered them, and they stood on their feet, and those who saw them were terrified. 12 Then they[c] heard a loud voice from heaven saying to them, ‘Come up here!’ And they went up to heaven in a cloud while their enemies watched them. 13 At that moment there was a great earthquake, and a tenth of the city fell; seven thousand people were killed in the earthquake, and the rest were terrified and gave glory to the God of heaven. 14 The second woe has passed. The third woe is coming very soon. The Seventh Trumpet
           15 Then the seventh angel blew his trumpet, and there were loud voices in heaven, saying, ‘The kingdom of the world has become the kingdom of our Lord
               and of his Messiah,[d]
           and he will reign for ever and ever.’
           16 Then the twenty-four elders who sit on their thrones before God fell on their faces and worshipped God, 17 singing, ‘We give you thanks, Lord God Almighty,
               who are and who were,
           for you have taken your great power
               and begun to reign.
           18 The nations raged,
               but your wrath has come,
               and the time for judging the dead,
           for rewarding your servants,[e] the prophets
               and saints and all who fear your name,
               both small and great,
           and for destroying those who destroy the earth.’
           19 Then God’s temple in heaven was opened, and the ark of his covenant was seen within his temple; and there were flashes of lightning, rumblings, peals of thunder, an earthquake, and heavy hail. ### miscs Ephesians 2:19-22 19 So then you are no longer strangers and aliens, but you are citizens with the saints and also members of the household of God, 20 built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets, with Christ Jesus himself as the cornerstone.[a] 21 In him the whole structure is joined together and grows into a holy temple in the Lord; 22 in whom you also are built together spiritually[b] into a dwelling-place for God. 1 Peter 2:5 5 like living stones, let yourselves be built[a] into a spiritual house, to be a holy priesthood, to offer spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God through Jesus Christ.

      abstract:
        - Bioconductor is a widely used open source and open development
          software project for the analysis and comprehension of data arising
          from high-throughput experimentation in genomics and molecular
          biology. Bioconductor is rooted in the open source statistical
          computing environment R. This volume's coverage is broad and ranges
          across most of the key capabilities of the Bioconductor project,
          including importation and preprocessing of high-throughput data from
          microarray, proteomic, and flow cytometry platforms curation and
          delivery of biological metadata for use in statistical modeling and
          interpretation statistical analysis of high-throughput data, including
          machine learning and visualization, modeling and visualization of
          graphs and networks. The developers of the software, who are in many
          cases leading academic researchers, jointly authored chapters. All
          methods are illustrated with publicly available data, and a major
          section of the book is devoted to exposition of fully worked case
          studies. This book is more than a static collection of descriptive
          text, figures, and code examples that were run by the authors to
          produce the text; it is a dynamic document. Code underlying all of the
          computations that are shown is made available on a companion website,
          and readers can reproduce every number, figure, and table on their own
          computers.

          <h4>L'exemple du Zettelkasten</h4>   


          https://i0.wp.com/www.mt-online.de/_em_daten/_mt/2011/08/24/110824_2115_306736507_0.jpg 


          J'ajoute un dernier élément parce qu'il me fascine et que je compte en reparler la semaine prochaine en exposant mes méthodes de travail. Le classement de la documentation a bien sûr existé avant les outils informatiques. Le sociologue allemand Nikolas Luhmann (1927-1998) a développé une méthode qui lui est propre, en utilisant de façon extensive des fiches en papier. La meilleure description que j'ai pu trouver en anglais se trouve http://takingnotenow.blogspot.de/2007/12/luhmanns-zettelkasten.html, mais si cela vous intéresse et que vous lisez l'allemand, je vous encourage à lire le chapitre ou Luhmann lui-même explique son système : <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Luhmann</span> Niklas, « Kommunikation mit Zettelkästen: Ein Erfahrungsbericht », <i>in</i> André <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Kieserling</span> (éd.), <i>Universität als Milieu</i>, Bielefeld, Haux, 1992, pp. 53-61. 


          Luhmann notait toutes les idées qui lui venaient de ses lectures ou d'ailleurs et il les reliait aux notes préexistantes par un système de numérotation extensible et sous-divisible à l'infini. Ils ne prenait pas des notes pour un projet spécifique, mais alimentait en quelque sorte en permanence sa base, le « Zettelkasten ». Dans l'analyse citée ci-dessus il explique qu'il se faisait souvent surprendre par les liens entre idées qui deviennent apparents par son système de classement et lui inspirent de nouveaux travaux. Pour Luhmann, sa « boîte à fiches » est son « Zweitgedächtnis », une sorte de cerveau secondaire ou deuxième cerveau qui fait apparaître ses idées sous d'autres angles. Après la mort de Luhmann un long combat a commencé entre les ayant-droit et les chercheurs intéressés par ce fond énorme que représente la « boite à fiches ». Il est aujourd'hui http://www.stifterverband.info/presse/pressemitteilungen/2011/2011_06_15_luhmann_nachlass/index.html et des chercheurs essaient maintenant de http://www.dradio.de/dlf/sendungen/kulturheute/1496578/. 


          Voici une vidéo où Luhmann lui-même explique le fonctionnement de son « Zettelkasten »:

      abstract:
        - The development of small-scale digital and analog quantum devices
          raises the question of how to fairly assess and compare the
          computational power of classical and quantum devices, and of how to
          detect quantum speedup. Here we show how to define and measure quantum
          speedup in various scenarios, and how to avoid pitfalls that might
          mask or fake quantum speedup. We illustrate our discussion with data
          from a randomized benchmark test on a D-Wave Two device with up to 503
          qubits. Comparing the performance of the device on random spin glass
          instances with limited precision to simulated classical and quantum
          annealers, we find no evidence of quantum speedup when the entire data
          set is considered, and obtain inconclusive results when comparing
          subsets of instances on an instance-by-instance basis. Our results for
          one particular benchmark do not rule out the possibility of speedup
          for other classes of problems and illustrate that quantum speedup is
          elusive and can depend on the question posed.

          27/03/16 - overview - studying the papers of Ashoke 


          This paper is of great importance because it constructs a fully consistent quantum action for (covariant) superstring field theory, including the Ramond sector. The idea is to introduce extra dynamical fields which are free (they don't even couple to gravity) and so they can be consistently decoupled.

      abstract:
        - The development of small-scale digital and analog quantum devices
          raises the question of how to fairly assess and compare the
          computational power of classical and quantum devices, and of how to
          detect quantum speedup. Here we show how to define and measure quantum
          speedup in various scenarios, and how to avoid pitfalls that might
          mask or fake quantum speedup. We illustrate our discussion with data
          from a randomized benchmark test on a D-Wave Two device with up to 503
          qubits. Comparing the performance of the device on random spin glass
          instances with limited precision to simulated classical and quantum
          annealers, we find no evidence of quantum speedup when the entire data
          set is considered, and obtain inconclusive results when comparing
          subsets of instances on an instance-by-instance basis. Our results for
          one particular benchmark do not rule out the possibility of speedup
          for other classes of problems and illustrate that quantum speedup is
          elusive and can depend on the question posed.

        - We study the energy used by a production-level regional climate and

          CPU-GPU nodes. The code is optimised for both processor architectures,
          for which we investigate both time and energy to solution. Operational
          constraints for time to solution can be met with both processor types,
          although on different numbers of nodes. Energy to solution is a factor
          3 lower with GPUs, but strong scaling can be pushed to larger node
          counts with CPUs to minimize time to solution. Our data shows that an
          affine relationship exists between energy and nodehours consumed by
          the simulation. We use this property to devise a simple and practical

        - We study the energy used by a production-level regional climate and
          weather simulation code on a distributed memory system with hybrid
          CPU-GPU nodes. The code is optimised for both processor architectures,
          for which we investigate both time and energy to solution. Operational
          constraints for time to solution can be met with both processor types,
          although on different numbers of nodes. Energy to solution is a factor
          3 lower with GPUs, but strong scaling can be pushed to larger node
          counts with CPUs to minimize time to solution. Our data shows that an
          affine relationship exists between energy and nodehours consumed by
          the simulation. We use this property to devise a simple and practical
          methodology for optimising for energy efficiency that can be applied
          to other applications, which we demonstrate with the HPCG benchmark.
          We conclude with a discussion about the relationship to the
          commonly-used GF/Watt metric.

        - We introduce Adam, an algorithm for first-order gradient-based
          optimization of stochastic objective functions, based on adaptive
          estimates of lower-order moments. The method is straightforward to
          implement, is computationally efficient, has little memory
          requirements, is invariant to diagonal rescaling of the gradients, and
          is well suited for problems that are large in terms of data and/or
          parameters. The method is also appropriate for non-stationary
          objectives and problems with very noisy and/or sparse gradients. The
          hyper-parameters have intuitive interpretations and typically require
          little tuning. Some connections to related algorithms, on which Adam
          was inspired, are discussed. We also analyze the theoretical
          convergence properties of the algorithm and provide a regret bound on
          the convergence rate that is comparable to the best known results
          under the online convex optimization framework. Empirical results
          demonstrate that Adam works well in practice and compares favorably to
          other stochastic optimization methods. Finally, we discuss AdaMax, a
          variant of Adam based on the infinity norm.

        - 本文探讨了支持向量机方法在降雨-径流预测中的应用。该方法采用结构风险最小化准则,弥补了人工神经网络在预测应用中的不足,较好地解决了小样本,非线性、高维数和局部最小点等实际问题。并且本研究通过与人工神经网络预测方法、传统的回归分析预测方法比较研究,得出支持向量机能取得更高精度的降雨-径流预测值。

        - The adsorption site of pyridine (C5H5N) on Ni{111} has been
          investigated by scanned-energy mode photoelectron diffraction using
          the N 1s core level. It was found that the nitrogen atom adsorbs close
          to the atop position with an angle of 18°( + 2°− 4°) between the NNi
          bond and the surface normal. The NNi bond length is 1.97 ± 0.03 Å.
          Since recent X-ray absorption studies show that the π system of the
          pyridine is also tilted by about 20° away from the surface normal, we
          conclude that the NNi bond and the ring plane are co-planar.

        - The characteristics of high-speed air-entrained jet flow over a
          spillway aerator were investigated using experimental data. Three
          different ramp designs (as well as the case of no ramp) were tested in
          a channel where the bed slope was adjusted to 0, 0.17, and 0.57,
          respectively. The effects of aerator geometry and flow condition on
          the air-entrainment process within the water jet and on the pressure
          fluctuations in the impact region are the main focus of the
          investigation. An extensive data analysis was performed for the data
          obtained from this study and from a similar laboratory study conducted
          by another investigator. Experimental relations were derived for
          nondimensional parameters of jet length, aerator cavity subpressure
          number, and aeration rates through the lower and upper nappes of the
          water jet. Scale effects for lower nappe aeration and aerator cavity
          subpressure number were considered and a good correlation was
          determined with prototype aerator measurements of Emborcaçao, Foz do
          Areia, and Keban dams for lower nappe aeration and Guri Dam for
          aerator cavity subpressure numbers. An aerator without a ramp may be
          subjected to excessive pressure fluctuations at the impact region due
          to insufficient air entrainment.

      abstract:
        - Gene expression in a tissue-specific context depends on the combined
          efforts of epigenetic, transcriptional and post-transcriptional
          processes that lead to the production of specific proteins that are
          important determinants of cellular identity. Ribosomes are a central
          component of the protein biosynthesis machinery in cells; however,
          their regulatory roles in the translational control of gene expression
          in skeletal muscle remain to be defined. In a genetic screen to
          identify critical regulators of myogenesis, we identified a DEAD-Box
          RNA helicase, DDX27, that is required for skeletal muscle growth and
          regeneration. We demonstrate that DDX27 regulates ribosomal RNA (rRNA)
          maturation, and thereby the ribosome biogenesis and the translation of
          specific transcripts during myogenesis. These findings provide insight
          into the translational regulation of gene expression in myogenesis and
          suggest novel functions for ribosomes in regulating gene expression in
          skeletal muscles.

      abstract:
        - Centronuclear myopathies (CNM) are a subtype of congenital myopathies
          (CM) characterized by skeletal muscle weakness and an increase in the
          number of central myonuclei. We have previously identified three CNM
          probands, two with associated dilated cardiomyopathy, carrying
          striated preferentially expressed gene (SPEG) mutations. Currently,
          the role of SPEG in skeletal muscle function is unclear as
          constitutive SPEG-deficient mice developed severe dilated
          cardiomyopathy and died in utero. We have generated a conditional
          Speg-KO mouse model and excised Speg by crosses with striated
          muscle-specific cre-expressing mice (MCK-Cre). The resulting litters
          had a delay in Speg excision consistent with cre expression starting
          in early postnatal life and, therefore, an extended lifespan up to a
          few months. KO mice were significantly smaller and weaker than their
          littermate-matched controls. Histopathological skeletal muscle
          analysis revealed smaller myofibers, marked fiber-size variability,
          and poor integrity and low number of triads. Further, SPEG-deficient
          muscle fibers were weaker by physiological and in vitro studies and
          exhibited abnormal Ca2+ handling and excitation-contraction (E-C)
          coupling. Overall, SPEG deficiency in skeletal muscle is associated
          with fewer and abnormal triads, and defective calcium handling and
          excitation-contraction coupling, suggesting that therapies targeting
          calcium signaling may be beneficial in such patients.

        - Virtually all ITS applications rely on accurate traffic data.
          Identification of faulty detectors is thus vital for their reliability
          and efficiency. Most existing approaches solely use current and
          historical data of single or adjacent detectors and are based on
          empirical thresholds. We present a method for fault detection using
          Floating-Car Data (FCD) as independent source of information which
          allows to distinguish changed traffic conditions from sensor faults.
          Fault detection is based on residuals of a nonlinear regression model
          fitted to detector readings and FCD traffic speeds. Instead of
          applying rule-of-thumb thresholds we employ a statistical test, where
          thresholds result naturally from historical data, sample sizes and
          required fault detection accuracy. We provide a theoretical framework
          for fault detectability analysis and empirically evaluate the fault
          detection capability of our approach using data obtained from a
          microscopic traffic simulation.

        - In designing computer-based systems, we work within a perspective that
          shapes the design questions that will be asked and the kinds of
          solutions that are sought. This paper introduces a perspective based
          on language as action, and explores its consequences for practical
          system design. The language/action perspective is contrasted to a
          number of other currently prominent perspectives, and is illustrated
          with an extended example based on studies of nursing work in a
          hospital ward. We show how it leads to particular analyses of that
          work, which reveal potentials for creating new designs that can make
          the work (and the workers) more effective.

      abstract:
        - Virtually all ITS applications rely on accurate traffic data.
          Identification of faulty detectors is thus vital for their reliability
          and efficiency. Most existing approaches solely use current and
          historical data of single or adjacent detectors and are based on
          empirical thresholds. We present a method for fault detection using
          Floating-Car Data (FCD) as independent source of information which
          allows to distinguish changed traffic conditions from sensor faults.
          Fault detection is based on residuals of a nonlinear regression model
          fitted to detector readings and FCD traffic speeds. Instead of
          applying rule-of-thumb thresholds we employ a statistical test, where
          thresholds result naturally from historical data, sample sizes and
          required fault detection accuracy. We provide a theoretical framework
          for fault detectability analysis and empirically evaluate the fault
          detection capability of our approach using data obtained from a
          microscopic traffic simulation.

      abstract:
        - When averaged over large scales, star formation in galaxies is
          observed to follow the empirical Kennicutt-Schmidt (KS) law for
          surface densities above a constant threshold. While the observed law
          involves surface densities, theoretical models and simulations
          generally work with volume density laws (i.e. Schmidt laws). We derive
          analytic relations between star formation laws expressed in terms of
          surface densities, volume densities, and pressures and we show how
          these relations depend on parameters such as the effective equation of
          state of the multiphase interstellar medium. Our analytic relations
          enable us to implement observed surface density laws into simulations.
          Because the parameters of our prescription for star formation are
          observables, we are not free to tune them to match the observations.
          We test our theoretical framework using high-resolution simulations of
          isolated disc galaxies that assume an effective equation of state for
          the multiphase interstellar medium. We are able to reproduce the star
          formation threshold and both the slope and the normalization of
          arbitrary input KS laws without tuning any parameters and with very
          little scatter, even for unstable galaxies and even if we use poor
          numerical resolution. Moreover, we can do so for arbitrary effective
          equations of state. Our prescription therefore enables simulations of
          galaxies to bypass our current inability to simulate the formation of
          stars. On the other hand, the fact that we can reproduce arbitrary
          input thresholds and KS laws, rather than just the particular ones
          picked out by nature, indicates that simulations that lack the physics
          and/or resolution to simulate the multiphase interstellar medium can
          only provide limited insight into the origin of the observed star
          formation laws.

        - >-
          For implementing observed KS relations into simulation. Describes the
          connection between SF law based on surface density (KS) and volume
          density (Schmidt). Includes some implementation advice for SF based on
          Schmidt laws. Suggests the use of a (polytropic) effective EOS to
          encapsulate the multiphase nature &amp; unmodeled physics of the ISM. 


          Simulations show the KS-Schmidt connection developed herein, and the Schmidt implementation, do a good job of reproducing the input KS relation (incl. surface density threshold). Result is robust to winds and low resolution, though with wind it may deviate near threshold depending on how surface density is calculated. Result also roughly holds for changes in the polytropic index, but changing the effective EOS can cause instability &amp; therefore increase SF. Authors stress that matching local SF conditions is more informative than matching global relations.

        - Infants use “unexpectedness” as a cue for learning. Stahl and
          Feigenson studied how babies reacted when objects behaved in
          surprising ways (see the Perspective by Schulz). Babies who saw
          apparently solid and weighty objects moving through a wall or past the
          edge of a table without falling looked intently at them. When given
          the opportunity to explore these peculiar objects, they did so by
          banging them on the floor—as if to test their solidity—or dropping
          them—as if to test their weightiness.

      abstract:
        - Introduction Emergency department (ED) visits increase during the
          influenza seasons. It is essential to identify statistically
          significant correlates in order to develop an accurate forecasting
          model for ED visits. Forecasting influenza-like-illness (ILI)-related
          ED visits can significantly help in developing robust resource
          management strategies at the EDs. Methods We first performed
          correlation analyses to understand temporal correlations between
          several predictors of ILI-related ED visits. We used the data
          available for Douglas County, the biggest county in Nebraska, for
          Omaha, the biggest city in the state, and for a major hospital in
          Omaha. The data set included total and positive influenza test results
          from the hospital (ie, Antigen rapid (Ag) and Respiratory Syncytial
          Virus Infection (RSV) tests); an Internet-based influenza surveillance
          system data, that is, Google Flu Trends, for both Nebraska and Omaha;
          total ED visits in Douglas County attributable to ILI; and ILI
          surveillance network data for Douglas County and Nebraska as the
          predictors and data for the hospital's ILI-related ED visits as the
          dependent variable. We used Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving
          Average and Holt Winters methods with3 linear regression models to
          forecast ILI-related ED visits at the hospital and evaluated model
          performances by comparing the root means square errors (RMSEs).
          Results Because of strong positive correlations with ILI-related ED
          visits between 2008 and 2012, we validated the use of Google Flu
          Trends data as a predictor in an ED influenza surveillance tool. Of
          the 5 forecasting models we have tested, linear regression models
          performed significantly better when Google Flu Trends data were
          included as a predictor. Regression models including Google Flu Trends
          data as a predictor variable have lower RMSE, and the lowest is
          achieved when all other variables are also included in the model in
          our forecasting experiments for the first 5 weeks of 2013 (with RMSE =
          57.61). Conclusions Google Flu Trends data statistically improve the
          performance of predicting ILI-related ED visits in Douglas County, and
          this result can be generalized to other communities. Timely and
          accurate estimates of ED volume during the influenza season, as well
          as during pandemic outbreaks, can help hospitals plan their ED
          resources accordingly and lower their costs by optimizing supplies and
          staffing and can improve service quality by decreasing ED wait times
          and overcrowding.

      abstract:
        - "The advent of complete genetic linkage maps consisting of codominant
          DNA markers [typically restriction fragment length polymorphisms
          (RFLPs)] has stimulated interest in the systematic genetic dissection
          of discrete Mendelian factors underlying quantitative traits in
          experimental organisms. We describe here a set of analytical methods
          that modify and extend the classical theory for mapping such
          quantitative trait loci (QTLs). These include: (i) a method of
          identifying promising crosses for QTL mapping by exploiting a
          classical formula of SEWALL WRIGHT; (ii) a method (interval mapping)
          for exploiting the full power of RFLP linkage maps by adapting the
          approach of LOD score analysis used in human genetics, to obtain
          accurate estimates of the genetic location and phenotypic effect of
          QTLs; and (iii) a method (selective genotyping) that allows a
          substantial reduction in the number of progeny that need to be scored
          with the DNA markers. In addition to the exposition of the methods,
          explicit graphs are provided that allow experimental geneticists to
          estimate, in any particular case, the number of progeny required to
          map QTLs underlying a quantitative trait."

      abstract:
        - "In suggesting that new nations often coalesce in the decades
          following war, historians have posed an important psychological
          question: Does the experience of war generate an enduring elevation in
          people's egalitarian motivations toward their in-group? We
          administered social-choice tasks to more than 1,000 children and
          adults differentially affected by wars in the Republic of Georgia and
          Sierra Leone. We found that greater exposure to war created a lasting
          increase in people's egalitarian motivations toward their in-group,
          but not their out-groups, during a developmental window starting in
          middle childhood (around 7 years of age) and ending in early adulthood
          (around 20 years of age). Outside this window, war had no measurable
          impact on social motivations in young children and had only muted
          effects on the motivations of older adults. These “war effects” are
          broadly consistent with predictions from evolutionary approaches that
          emphasize the importance of group cooperation in defending against
          external threats, though they also highlight key areas in need of
          greater theoretical development."

      abstract:
        - A distinctive feature of human behaviour is the widespread occurrence
          of cooperation among unrelated individuals. Explaining the maintenance
          of costly within-group cooperation is a challenge because the
          incentive to free ride on the efforts of other group members is
          expected to lead to decay of cooperation. However, the costs of
          cooperation can be diminished or overcome when there is competition at
          a higher level of organizational hierarchy. Here we show that
          competition between groups resolves the paradigmatic \`public goods'
          social dilemma and increases within-group cooperation and overall
          productivity. Further, group competition intensifies the moral
          emotions of anger and guilt associated with violations of the
          cooperative norm. The results suggest an important role for group
          conflict in the evolution of human cooperation and moral emotions.

        - Do societies choose inefficient policies and institutions? An
          extension of the Coase theorem to politics would suggest the answer is
          no. This paper discusses various approaches to political economy and
          develops the argument that there are strong empirical and theoretical
          grounds for believing that inefficient policies and institutions are
          prevalent. We conclude that these inefficient institutions and
          policies are chosen because they serve the interests of politicians or
          social groups that hold political power at the expense of the rest.
          The theoretical case depends on commitment problems inherent in
          politics; parties holding political power cannot make commitments to
          bind their future actions because there is no outside agency with the
          coercive capacity to enforce such arrangements. Journal of Comparative
          Economics 31 (4) (2003) 620-652.
