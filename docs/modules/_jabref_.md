## Functions

### parse

â–¸ **parse**(`comments`: string[]): [JabrefMetadata](../interfaces/_jabref_.jabrefmetadata.md)

Import the JabRef groups from the `@string` comments in which they were stored. You would typically pass the comments parsed by [[bibtex.parse]] in here.

JabRef knows several group types, and this parser parses most, but not all of them:

* independent group: the keys listed in the group are the entries that are considered to belong to it
* intersection: the keys listed in the group are considered to belong to the group if they're also in the parent group
* union: the keys listed in the group are considered to belong to the group, and also the keys that are in the parent group
* query: not supported by this parser

#### Parameters:

Name | Type |
------ | ------ |
`comments` | string[] |

**Returns:** [JabrefMetadata](../interfaces/_jabref_.jabrefmetadata.md)
