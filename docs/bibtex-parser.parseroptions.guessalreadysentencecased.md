## ParserOptions.guessAlreadySentenceCased property

Some bibtex has titles in sentence case, or all-uppercase. If this is on, and there is a field that would normally have sentence-casing applied in which more words are all-`X`<!-- -->case (where `X` is either lower or upper) than mixed-case, it is assumed that you want them this way, and no sentence-casing will be applied to that field

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
guessAlreadySentenceCased?: boolean;
```
