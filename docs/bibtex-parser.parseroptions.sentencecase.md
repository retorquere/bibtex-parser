## ParserOptions.sentenceCase property

BibTeX files are expected to store title-type fields in Sentence Case, where other reference managers (such as Zotero) expect them to be stored as Sentence case. When there is no language field, or the language field is one of the languages (case insensitive) passed in this option, the parser will attempt to sentence-case title-type fields as they are being parsed. This uses heuristics and does not employ any kind of natural language processing, so you should always inspect the results. Default languages to sentenceCase are:

- american - british - canadian - english - australian - newzealand - usenglish - ukenglish - en - eng - en-au - en-bz - en-ca - en-cb - en-gb - en-ie - en-jm - en-nz - en-ph - en-tt - en-us - en-za - en-zw

If you pass an empty array, or `false`<!-- -->, no sentence casing will be applied (even when there's no language field).

**Signature:**

```typescript
sentenceCase?: string[] | boolean;
